            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Know not a more lively deſcription in the whole Book of God, of the Natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion derived from our firſt Parents, than theſe words; Wherein you have the Ground of that <hi>grief,</hi> which lay ſo cloſe to God's heart, <hi>v.</hi> 6. &amp; the Reſolve thereupon to deſtroy man, and whatſoever was ſerviceable to that ungrateful creature. That muſt be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive, which moved God to repent of a fabrick ſo pleaſing to him at the creation: every ſtone in the building being at the firſt laying pronounced <hi>good</hi> by Him, and upon a review at the finiſhing the whole, He left it the ſame character with an Emphaſis;<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note>

               <hi>wiſdom,</hi> it was a very comely piece of Art. What then ſhould provoke him to repent of ſo excellent a work? <hi>The wickedneſs of man, which was great in the earth.</hi> How came it to paſs that man's wickedneſs ſhould ſwell ſo high? Whence did it ſpring? From the <hi>imagination.</hi> Though theſe might be ſinful imaginations, might not the ſuperiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty preſerve it ſelf untainted? Alas! That was defiled; <hi>The imagination of the thoughts</hi> was evil. But though running thoughts might wheel about in his mind, yet they might leave no ſtamp or impreſſion upon the will and affections. Yes, they did, <hi>The imagination of the thoughts of his heart was evil.</hi> Surely all could not be under ſuch a blemiſh: Were there not now and then ſome pure flaſhes of the mind? No not one; <hi>Every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But granting that they were evil, might there not be ſome fleeting good mixed with them: as a poiſonous toad hath ſomething uſeful? No, <hi>Only evil.</hi> Well, but there might be ſome intervals of thinking, and though there was no good thought, yet evil ones were not always rouling there. Yes, they were <hi>Continually;</hi> not a moment of time that man was free from them. One would ſcarce imagine ſuch an inward neſt of wickedneſs, but God hath affirmed it; and if any man ſhould deny it, his own heart would give him the lye.</p>

This word <hi>imagination</hi> being joyn'd with <hi>thoughts,</hi> implies not only the compleat thoughts, but the firſt motion or formation of them, to be evil.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Heart</hi> is taken variouſly in Scripture. It ſignifies properly that inward member,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41445:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> which is the ſeat of the vital ſpirits: But ſometimes it ſignifies, 1.

But <hi>Heart</hi> here is uſed for the whole ſoul, becauſe (according to <hi>Pareus</hi> his note) the ſoul is chiefly ſeated in the heart, eſpecially the Will, and the affections her attendants; becauſe when any affection ſtirs, the chief motion of it is felt in the heart. So that by the <hi>imaginations of the thoughts of the heart</hi> are here meant all the inward operations of the ſoul, which play their part principally in the heart: whether they be the acts of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reſolutions of the Will, or the bluſtrings of the affections.</p>

Thought firſt engenders <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in the <hi>mind;</hi> thought ſpurs the <hi>will</hi> to <hi>conſent</hi> or <hi>diſſent;</hi> 'tis <hi>thought</hi> alſo which Spirits the <hi>affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not ſpend time to acquaint you with the methods of their generation. Every man knows he hath a thinking faculty, and ſome inward conceptions, which he calls thoughts, he knows that he thinks, and what he thinks; though he be not able to deſcribe the manner of their formation in the womb, or remember it any more than the ſpecies of his own face in a glaſs.</p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe let us firſt ſee what kind of thoughts are ſins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively. <hi>A ſimple apprehenſion of ſin is not ſinful.</hi> Thoughts receive not a ſinfulneſs barely from the object: That may be unlawful to be acted, which is not unlawful to be thought of. Though the will cannot Will ſin without guilt, yet the underſtanding may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſin without guilt; for that doth no more contract a pollution by the bare apprehenſion, than the eye doth by the reception of the ſpecies of a loathſome object. Thoughts are moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil, when they have a bad <hi>principle,</hi> want a due <hi>end</hi> and converſe with the object in a wrong <hi>manner.</hi> Angels cannot but underſtand the offence which diſplaced the <hi>Apoſtate Stars</hi> from heaven; but they know not ſin <hi>cognitione practicâ:</hi> Glorified Saints may conſider their former ſins, to enhance their admirations of pardoning mercy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf muſt needs underſtand the matter of the Devils temptation; yet Satan's ſuggeſtions to his thoughts were as the vapors of a jakes mixed with the Sun-beams, without a defilement of them. Yea God himſelf, who is infinite purity, knows the Object of his own acts, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about ſin; as his holineſs in forbidding it, wiſdom in permitting, mercy in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41445:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> pardoning, and juſtice in puniſhing. But thoughts of ſin in Chriſt, Angels, and glorified Saints, are accompanied with an abhorrency of it, without any combuſtible matter in them to be kindled by it. As our thoughts of a divine object are not gracious, unleſs we love and delight in it; ſo a bare apprehenſion of ſin is not poſitively criminal, unleſs we delight in the object apprehended. As a ſinful obiect doth not render our thoughts evil, ſo a divine object doth not render them good; becauſe we may think of it with undue circumſtances, as unſeaſonably, coldly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus there is an imperfection in the beſt thought a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man hath; for though I will ſuppoſe he may have a ſudden ejaculation without the mixture of any poſitive impurity, and a ſimple apprehenſion of ſin, with a deteſtation of it, yet there is a defect in each of them; becauſe 'tis not with that raiſed affection to God, or intenſe abhorrency of ſin, as is due from us to ſuch objects, and whereof we were capable in our primitive ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſitively. Our thoughts may be branched into firſt motions, or ſuch that are more voluntary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt motions;</hi> Thoſe unfleched thoughts, and ſingle threads, before a multitude of them come to be twiſted and woven into a diſcourſe: ſuch as skip up from our natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and ſink down again as fiſh in a River. Theſe are ſins, though we conſent not to them; becauſe, though they are without our <hi>will,</hi> they are not againſt our <hi>nature,</hi> but ſpring from an inordinate frame, of a different hue from what God implanted in us. How can the firſt ſprouts be good, if the root be evil? Not only the thought formed, but the very formation, or firſt imagination is evil. Voluntarineſs is not neceſſary to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a ſin, though it be to the <hi>aggravation</hi> of it. 'Tis not my Will or Knowledge,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.33, 35.</note> which doth make an act ſinful, but God's prohibition. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt was not uſhered by any deliberate conſent of his Will; yet who will deny it to be a ſin, ſince he ſhould have exerciſed a ſeverer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over himſelf, than to be overtaken with drunkenneſs, which was the occaſion of it? Original ſin is not <hi>effectivè</hi> voluntary in Infants; becauſe no act of the will is exerted in an infant about it: Yet it is voluntary <hi>ſubjectivè;</hi> becauſe it doth <hi>inhaerere voluntati.</hi> Theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be ſaid to be voluntary <hi>negatively,</hi> becauſe the Will doth not ſet bounds to them, and exerciſe that ſoveraign dominion over the operations of the ſoul, which it ought to do, and wherewith it was at its firſt creation inveſted. Beſides, though the Will doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conſent to them, yet it conſents to the occaſions, which adminiſter ſuch motions; and therefore, according to the rule, that <hi>cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati,</hi> they may be juſtly charged upon our ſcore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Voluntary thoughts,</hi> which are the bloſſoms of theſe motions. Such that have no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object, no right end, not governed by reaſon, eccentrick, diſorderly in their motions, and like the jarring ſtrings of an untun'd Inſtrument. The meaneſt of theſe floating phancies are ſins; becauſe we act not in the production of them, as rational creatures: and what we do without reaſon, we do againſt the law of our creation, which appointed reaſon for our guide, and the underſtanding to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the governing power in our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Theſe may be reduced to three heads,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of God. 2. Of our ſelves. 3. Of others.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In regard of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Cold thoughts of God;</hi> When no affection is raiſed in us by them. When we delight not in God, the object of thoſe thoughts, but in the thought it ſelf, and operation of our mind about Him, conſiſting of ſome quaint notion of God of our own conceiving. This is to delight in the <hi>act</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of thinking, not in the <hi>object</hi> thought of; and thus theſe thoughts have a folly and vanity in them. They are alſo ſinful in a regenerate man, in reſpect of the faintneſs of the underſtanding, not acting with that vigor, and ſpritelineſs, nor with thoſe raiſed and ſpiritual affections, which the worth of ſuch an object doth require.</p>

Theſe pleaſing impoſtures, and ſelf-afflicting ſuppoſitions are ſigns either of an idle, or indigent mind, that hath no will to work, or only rotten materials to work upon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Immoderate thoughts about lawful things:</hi> When we exerciſe our minds too thick, and with a fierceneſs of affection above their merit: not in ſubſerviency to God, or mixing our cares with dependencies on Him. Worldly concerns may quarter in our thoughts; but they muſt not poſſeſs all the room, and thruſt Chriſt into a manger: Neither muſt they be of that value with us, as the law was with <hi>David,</hi> ſweeter than the honey or the honey comb.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>In regard of others;</hi> All thoughts of our neighbour againſt the Rule of Charity. <hi>Such that imagine evil in their hearts, God hates</hi>

And <hi>Eſau</hi> thought of the daies of mourning for his Father, that he might be revenged for his Brother's deceits.</p>
            <p>There is no ſin committed in the world, but is hatched in one or other of theſe thoughts. But beſide theſe, there are a multitude of other volatile conceits, like ſwarms of Gnats buzzing about us, and preying upon us, and as frequent in their ſucceſſions, as the curlings of the water upon a ſmall breath of wind, one following another cloſe at the heels. The mind is no more ſatisfied with thoughts, than the firſt matter is with forms, continually ſhifting one for another, and many times the nobler for the baſer: as when upon the putrefaction of a human body, part of the Matter is endued with the form of Vermin. Such changeable things are our minds, in leaving that which is good for that which is worſe, when they are enveigled by an active fancy, and Bedlam affections. This <hi>madneſs is in the hearts of men while they live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.3.</note> and ſtarts a thouſand frenzies in a day. At the beſt our phancy is like a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's bag,</hi> ſtuffed with a world of Letters, having no dependence upon one another; ſome containing buſineſs, and others nothing but froth.</p>
            <p>In all theſe thoughts there is a further guilt in three reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Delight,</hi> 2. <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> 3. <hi>Reacting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Delight</hi> in them. The very tickling of our phancy by a ſinful motion, though without a formal conſent, is a ſin; becauſe it is a degree of complacency in an unlawful object. When the mind is pleaſed with the ſubject of the thought, as it hath a tendency to ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41445:4"/> ſenſual pleaſure, &amp; not ſimply in the thought it ſelf, as it may enrich the underſtanding with ſome degree of knowledg. The thought indeed of an evil thing may be without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the evil of it; as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> delight in making experiments of poiſonous Creatures, without delighting in the poiſon, as it is a noxious quality. We may delightfully think of ſin without guilt, not delighting in it as ſin, but as God by his wiſe providential ordering extracts Glory to himſelf, and good to his Creature. In this caſe, though a ſinful act be the <hi>material object</hi> of this pleaſure, yet 'tis not the <hi>formal object:</hi> becauſe the delight is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the ſin, but in God's ordering the event of it to his own glory. But an Inclination to a ſinful motion, as it gratifies a corrupt affection, is ſin: becauſe every Inclination is a malignant tincture upon the affections, including in its own nature an averſion from God, and teſtifying ſin to be an agreeable object. And without queſtion, there can be no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any thing, without ſome degree of pleaſure in it: becauſe it is impoſſible we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to that, which we have a perfect abhorrency of. Hence it follows, that every inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſinful motion is <hi>Conſenſus inchoatus,</hi> or a Conſent in <hi>Embryo:</hi> though the act may prove abortive. If we think of any unlawful thing with pleaſure, and imagine it either in <hi>fieri</hi> or <hi>facto eſſe,</hi> it brings a guilt upon us, as if it were really acted. As when upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch a man's being my enemy, I phancy robbers rifling his goods, and cutting his throat, and rejoyce in this revengeful thought, as if it were really done, 'tis a great ſin: becauſe it teſtifies an approbation of ſuch a butchery, if any man had will and opportunity to commit it. And though it be a ſuppoſition, yet the act of the mind is really the ſame it would be, if the ſinfull act I think of were performed. Or when a man conditionally thinks with himſelf, I would ſteal ſuch a man's goods, or kill ſuch a perſon, if I could eſcape the puniſhment attending it, it is as if he did rob and murder him: becauſe there is no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in his will to the commiſſion of it, but only in the outward circumſtances. Nay though it be a mere <hi>Ens intentionale,</hi> or <hi>rationis,</hi> which is the object of the thought, yet the act of the mind is real, and as ſignificant of the inclination of the Soul, as if the object were real too: As if a man hath an unclean motion at the ſight of a picture, which is only a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of well mixed and well ordered colours: or at the appearance of the Idea of a beauty fram'd in his own phancy: 'tis as much uncleanneſs as if it were terminated in ſome ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object, the hinderance being not in the will, but in the inſufficiency of the object to concur in ſuch an act. Now as the more delight there is in any holy ſervice, the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious it is in it ſelf, and more grateful to God: ſo the more pleaſure there is in any ſinful motion, the more malignity there is in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Contrivance.</hi> When the delight in the thought grows up to the contrivance of the act, (which is ſtill the work of the thinking faculty:) When the mind doth brood upon a ſinful motion, to hatch it up, and invents methods for performance: which the wiſe man calls <hi>artificial Inventions.</hi> So a learned man interprets <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>There are three Reaſons for the proof of this, that they are Sins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are contrary to the Law,</hi> which doth forbid the firſt foamings and belchings of the heart; becauſe they ariſe from an habitual corruption, and teſtifie a defect of ſomething, which the <hi>Law</hi> requires to be in us, to correct the excurſions of our minds. Doth not the <hi>Law</hi> oblige man as a <hi>rational</hi> creature? Shall it then leave that part, which doth conſtitute him rational, to fleeting and giddy fancies? No, it binds the ſoul as the principal agent, the body only as the inſtrument. For if it were given only for the ſenſitive part, without any reſpect to the rational, it would concern brutes as well as men, which are as capable of a rational command, and a voluntary obedience, as man without the conduct of a rational ſoul. It exacts a conformity of the whole man to God, and prohibits a difformity; and therefore engageth chiefly the inward part, which is moſt the man. It muſt then extend to all the acts of the man, conſequently to his thoughts, they being more the acts of the man than the motions of the body. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the prime excellency of the <hi>Law,</hi> a title aſcribed to it twice in one Verſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy, juſt and good.</hi> Could it be <hi>holy,</hi> if it indulged looſeneſs in the more noble part of the creature? Could it be <hi>juſt,</hi> if it favoured inward unrighteouſneſs? Could it be <hi>good,</hi> and uſeful to man, which did not enjoyn a ſuitable conformity to God, wherein the creatures excellency lies? Can that deſerve the title of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Law, that ſhould only regulate the brutiſh part, and leave the ſpiritual to an unbounded licentiouſneſs? Can <hi>perfection</hi> be aſcribed to that Law,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note> which doth countenance the unſavoury breathings of the Spirit, and lay no ſtricter an obligation upon us than the Laws of men? Muſt not God's Laws be as ſuitable to his Soveraignty, as mens Laws are to theirs? Muſt they not then be as extenſive as God's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and reach even to the privateſt cloſets of the heart? 'Tis not for the honour of God's holineſs, righteouſneſs, goodneſs, to let the Spirit, which bears more flouriſhing characters of his Image than the body, range wildly about without a legal curb.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They are contrary to the order of nature, and the deſign of our Creation.</hi> Whatſoever is a ſwerving from our primitive nature,<note place="margin">

But all inclinations to ſin are contrary to that righteouſneſs, wherewith man was firſt endued. Man was creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both with a diſpoſition, and ability for holy contemplations of God; the firſt glances of his ſoul were pure; he came every way compleat out of the mint of his infinitely wiſe and good <hi>Creator;</hi> and when God pronounced all his Creatures good, he pronounced man very good amongſt the reſt. But man is not now as God created him, he is off from his end, his underſtanding is filled with lightneſs and vanity. This <hi>diſorder</hi> never proceeded from the God of <hi>order;</hi> infinite goodneſs could never produce ſuch an evil frame; none of theſe looſe inventions were of God's planting, but of man's ſeeking. No, God never created the intellective, no, nor the ſenſitive part, to play <hi>Domitian</hi>'s game, and ſport it ſelf in the catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Flies.<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.20. Gen. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>Man that is in honour, and underſtands not</hi> that which he ought to underſtand, and thinks not that which he ought to think, <hi>is like the Beaſts that periſh:</hi> he plays the beaſt, becauſe he acts contrary to the nature of a rational and immortal ſoul. And ſuch brutes we all naturally are, ſince the firſt woman believed her ſenſe, her phancy, her affection, in their directions for the attainment of wiſdom, without conſulting God's Law, or her own reaſon. The phancy was bound by the right of nature to ſerve the underſtanding: 'Tis then a ſlighting God's wiſdom to invert this order, in making that our Governour which he made our Subject. 'Tis injuſtice to the dignity of our own ſouls, to degrade the nobler part to a ſordid ſlavery; in making the brute have dominion over the man; as if the Horſe were fitteſt to govern the Rider. 'Tis a falſeneſs to God, and a breach of truſt, to let our minds be impoſed upon by our phancy; in giving them only feathers to dandle, and chaff to feed on, inſtead of thoſe braver objects they were made to converſe withal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We are accountable to God, and puniſhable for thoughts.</hi> Nothing is the meritorious cauſe of God's wrath but ſin.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41445:5"/> of this little world is known and cenſured by God. If our thoughts be not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God would not be a righteous judge.

               </note> they will alſo accuſe us for our contrary thoughts. Our good thoughts will be our accuſers for not obſerving them, and our bad thoughts will be indictments againſt us for complying with them. 'Tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Soul may be bound over to anſwer chiefly for theſe at the laſt day; for the Apoſtle chargeth <hi>Simon</hi>'s guilt upon his <hi>thought,</hi> not his word, and tells him, <hi>pardon</hi> muſt be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally granted for that. The tongue was only an Inſtrument to expreſs what his heart did think, and would have been wholly innocent, had not his thoughts been firſt criminal. What therefore is the principal ſubject of pardon, would be ſo of puniſhment: as the firſt incendiaries in a rebellion are moſt ſeverely dealt with. And if (as ſome think) the fallen Angels were ſtript of their primitive Glory, only for, a conceiv'd thought, how heinous muſt that be, which hath inrolled them in a remedileſs miſery?</p>
            <p>Having proved that there is a ſinfulneſs in our thoughts, let us now ſee what <hi>provocation</hi> there is in them: Which in ſome reſpects is greater than that of our <hi>actions.</hi> But we muſt take <hi>actions</hi> here in <hi>ſenſu diviſo,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the inward <hi>preparations</hi> to them.

                  </gap>fulneſs. The wickedneſs that God ſaw great in the earth</hi> was the fruit of <hi>imaginations.</hi> They are the immediate cauſes of all ſin. No Cockatrice but was firſt an Egg. It was a thought to be as God<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3.5. 2 Cor. 11.3.</note>, that was the firſt breeder of all that ſin, under which the world groans at this day; For <hi>Eve's mind</hi> was firſt <hi>beguiled</hi> in the alteration of her thought. Since that the lake of inward malignity acts all it's evil by theſe ſmoaking ſteams. Evil thoughts lead the van in our Saviour's Catalogue,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.19.</note> as that which ſpirits all the black regiment which march behind. As good motions cheriſh'd will ſpring up in good actions, ſo looſe thoughts favoured will break out in viſible plague-ſores, and put fire unto all that wickedneſs which lyes habitually in the heart: as a ſpark may to a whole ſtock of Gun-powder.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.16.</note> The <hi>vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings</hi> of the ſoul, as well as thoſe of the Tongue, <hi>will encreaſe to more ungodlineſs.</hi> Being thus the cauſe, they include virtually in them all that is in the effect; as a ſeed contains in its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle body the leaves, fruit, colour, ſcent, which afterward appear in the plant. The ſeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all, but the colour doth not virtually include the ſcent, or the ſcent the colour, or the leaves the fruit: ſo 'tis here, One act doth not include the formal obliquity of another: but the thought which cauſed it, doth ſeminally include both the formal &amp; final obliquity of every action; both that which is in the nature of it, and in the end to which it tends. As when a Trades-man cheriſheth immoderate thoughts of gain, and in the attaining it runs into <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts,</hi> there is cheating, lying, ſwearing, to put off the commodity:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9.</note> all theſe ſeveral acts have a particular ſinfulneſs in the nature of the acts themſelves, beſides the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency they have to the ſatisfying an inordinate affection; all which are the ſpawn of thoſe firſt immoderate thoughts ſtirring up greedy deſires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>Quantity.</hi> Imaginations are ſaid to be <hi>continually</hi> evil. There is an infinite variety of conceptions, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of the Sea, <hi>wherein are all things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great,</hi> and a conſtant generation of whole ſhoals of them; that you may as well number the Fiſh in the Sea, or the Atomes in the Sun-beams, as recount them.</p>

               </note>? Yea, how many ſinful thoughts are twiſted together to produce one deliberate ſinful word? All which have a diſtinct guilt, and, if weigh'd together, would outweigh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41445:6"/> the guilt of the action abſtractedly conſidered. How many repeated complacencies in the firſt motion, degrees of conſent, reſolved broodings, ſecret plottings, propoſals of various methods, ſmothering contrary checks, vehement longings, delightful hopes, and foreſtalled pleaſures in the deſign? All which are but thoughts aſſenting, or diſſenting in order to the act intended. Upon a diſſection of all theſe ſecret motions by the critical power of the word, we ſhould find a more monſtrous guilt, than would be apparent in the ſingle action, for whoſe ſake all theſe ſpirits were raiſed. There may be no ſin in a material act, conſidered in it ſelf, when there is a provoking guilt in the mental motion. A Hypocrite's Religious ſervices are materially good, but poiſoned by the Imagination skulking in the heart, that gave birth unto them. 'Tis the wicked mind or thought makes the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (a commanded duty) <hi>much more an abomination</hi> to the Lord.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſequent acts;</hi> When a man's phancy is pregnant with the delightful remembrance of the ſin that is paſt, he draws down a freſh guilt upon himſelf: as they did in the Prophet, in reviving the concurrence of the will to the act committed, making the ſenſual pleaſure to commence ſpiritual, and (if ever there were an aking heart for it) revoking his former grief by a renewed approbation of his darling luſt. Thus the ſin of thoughts is greater in regard of <hi>duration.</hi> A man hath neither ſtrength nor opportunity always to act, but he may always think; and <hi>imagination</hi> can ſupply the place of <hi>action.</hi> Or if the mind be tired with ſucking one object, it can with the Bee preſently faſten upon another. Senſes are weary, till they have a new recruit of ſpirits: as the poor horſe may ſink under his burden, when the rider is as violent as ever. Thus old men may change their outward profaneneſs into mental wickedneſs; and as the Pſalmiſt <hi>remembred</hi> his old ſongs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.5, 6. ſo they their calcin'd ſins in the <hi>night,</hi> with an equal pleaſure. So that you ſee there may be a thouſand thoughts as uſhers and lacqueys to one act, as numerous as the ſparks of a new lighted fire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>Objects</hi> the mind is converſant about. Such thoughts there are, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a heavy guilt, which cannot probably, no nor poſſibly deſcend into outward acts. A man may in a complacent thought commit fornication with a woman in <hi>Spain,</hi> in a covetous thought rob another in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and in a revengeful thought ſtab a third in <hi>America;</hi> and that while he is in this Congregation. An <hi>unclean perſon</hi> may commit a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal folly with every beauty he meets. A <hi>covetous</hi> man cannot plunder a whole kingdom; but in one twinkling of a thought he may wiſh himſelf the poſſeſſor of all the eſtates in it. A <hi>Timon,</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot cut the throats of all the world; but like <hi>Nero,</hi> with one glance of his heart he may chop off the heads of all mankind at a blow. An <hi>Ambitious</hi> man's practices are confined to a ſmall ſpot of land, but with a caſt of his mind he may graſp an Empire as large as the four Monarchies. A beggar cannot aſcend a throne; but in his thoughts he may paſs the Guards, murder his Prince and uſurp the Government. Nay further, an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> may think <hi>there is no God, Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> (as ſome interpret it) wiſh there were no God, and thus in thought undeifie God himſelf; though he may ſooner daſh heaven and earth in pieces, than accompliſh it. The body is confined to one object, and that narrow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to its nature: but the mind can wing it ſelf to various objects in all parts of the earth. Where it finds none, it can make one; for phancy can compact ſeveral objects together, coyn an image, colour a picture, and commit folly with it, when it hath done; It can neſtle it ſelf in cobwebs ſpun out of its own bowels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reſpect of <hi>Strength.</hi> Imaginations of the heart are <hi>only, i. e.</hi> purely evil. The nearer any thing is in union with the root, the more radical ſtrength it hath. The firſt ebullitions of light and heat from the Sun are more vigorous, than the remoter beams: and the ſteams of a dunghil more noyſom next that putrified body, than when they are dilated in the air. Grace is ſtronger in the heart-operations, than in the outward ſtreams: and ſin more foul in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart, than in the act, In the <hi>Text</hi> the outward <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of the world is paſſed over with a ſhort expreſſion; but the Holy Ghoſt dwells upon the deſcription of the <hi>wicked Imagination,</hi> becauſe there lay the maſs.

               </note>. This was the ſucceſsful means he uſed to ſtifle <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> and excite his hatred of them, 'Tis the property of love <hi>to think no evil,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. It thinks good and delightful thoughts of God; friendly and uſeful thoughts of others. It fixeth the Image of our beloved object in our minds, that 'tis not in the power of other phancies to diſplace it. The beauty of an object will faſten a roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye. 'Tis difficult to divorce our hearts and thoughts from that which appears lovely and glorious in our minds, whether it be God or the world. Love will by a pleaſing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence bind down our thoughts, and hunt away other affections. If it doth not eſtabliſh our minds, they will be like a Cork, which with a light breath, and a ſhort curl of water, ſhall be toſſed up and down from its ſtation. Scholars that love learning, will be continually hammering upon ſome notion or other, which may further their progreſs, and as greedily claſp it, as the Iron will its beloved Loadſtone, He that is wing'd with a divine love to Chriſt, will have frequent glances and flights towards him, and will ſtart out from his worldly buſineſs, ſeveral times in a day, to give him a viſit. Love in the very working is a ſettling grace; it encreaſeth our delight in God, partly by the ſight of his amiableneſs, which is clear'd to us in the very act of loving, and partly by the recompences he gives to the affectionate carriage of his creature; both which will ſtake down the heart from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies, or giving entertainment to ſuch looſe companions, as evil thoughts are. Well then, if we had this heavenly affection ſtrong in us, it would not ſuffer unwholeſom weeds to grow up ſo near it; either our Love would conſume thoſe weeds, or thoſe weeds will choak our Love.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Exerciſe Faith.</hi> As the habit of Faith is attended with habitual Sanctification, ſo the acts of Faith are accompanied with a progreſs in the degrees of it. That Faith which brings Chriſt to dwell in our Souls, will make us often think of our inmate. Faith doth reallize divine things, and make abſent objects as preſent; and ſo furniſheth fancy with richer ſtreams to bathe it ſelf in, than any other principle in the world. As there is a neceſſity of the uſe of fancy, while the ſoul is linked to the body; ſo there is alſo a neceſſity of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective for it.<note place="margin">Mirand. de Imaginat. c. <hi>11, 12.</hi>
               </note> Reaſon doth in part regulate it, but 'tis too weak to do it perfectly, becauſe fancy in moſt men is ſtronger than reaſon; man being the higheſt of imaginative beings, and the loweſt of intelligent; fancy is in its exaltation more than in creatures beneath him, and reaſon in its detriment more than in creatures above him; and therefore the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on needs a more skilful guide than reaſon.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41445:8"/> muſt come in, yet when we have diſpatch'd them, let us attend our morning Theme as our chief companion. As a man that is going with another about ſome conſiderable buſineſs, ſuppoſe to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> though he meets with ſeveral friends in the way, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes ſome, and with others with whom he hath ſome affairs he ſpends a little time, yet he quickly returns to his companion, and both together go their intended ſtage. Do thus in the preſent caſe.

If to voluptuouſneſs, fancy the pleaſures in the ways of wiſdom here, and at God's right hand hereafter. This is to deal with our hearts as <hi>Paul</hi> with his hearers,<note place="margin">The heads of the Catechiſm might be taken in order, which would both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and actuate our knowledge. <hi>Pſal. 40.5.</hi>
               </note> to <hi>catch</hi> them with <hi>guile.</hi> Stake your ſoul down to ſome ſerious and profitable myſtery of Religion; as the Majeſty of God, ſome particular Attribute, his condeſcenſion in Chriſt, the love of our Redeemer, the value of his ſufferings, the vertue of his blood, the end of his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the work of the Spirit, the excellency of the ſoul, beauty of holineſs, certainty of death, terror of judgment, torments of Hell, and joys of Heaven. Why may not that which was the ſubject of God's <hi>innumerable thoughts,</hi> be the ſubject of ours? God's thoughts and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were concerning Chriſt, the end of his coming, his death, his precepts of holineſs, and promiſes of life; and that not only ſpeculatively, but with an infinite pleaſure in his own glory, &amp; the creatures good to be accompliſhed by him. Would it not be work enough for our thoughts all the day to travel over the length, breadth, height, and depth of the love of Chriſt? Would the greatneſs of the journey give us leiſure to make any ſtarts out of the way? Having ſettled the Theme for all the day, we ſhall find occaſional aſſiſtances, even from worldly buſineſſes; as Scholars, who have ſome Exerciſe to make, find helps in their own courſe of reading, though the Book hath no deſign'd reſpect to their proper Theme. Thus by imploying our minds about one thing chiefly, we ſhall not only hinder them from vain excurſions, but make even common objects to be oyl to our good thoughts, which otherwiſe would have been fuel for our bad. Such generous liquor would ſcent our minds and converſations all the day; that whatſoever motion came into our hearts, would be tinctured with this ſpirit, and ſavour of our morning thoughts: as veſſels having been filled with a rich wine, communicate a reliſh of it to the liquors afterward put into them.

            <p n="1">1.

Let it be one principal ſubject, and without flitting from it; for if our thoughts be unſteady, we ſhall find but little warmth: a burning glaſs often ſhifted fires nothing. We muſt <hi>look</hi> at the things that are not <hi>ſeen,</hi> as wiſtly as men do at a mark they ſhoot at.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 2 Cor. 3.18.</note> Such an intent meditation would <hi>change</hi> us into the <hi>image,</hi> and caſt us into the mould of thoſe truths we think of; it would make our minds more buſie about them all the day: as a glaring upon the Sun fills our eyes for ſome time after with the image of it. To this purpoſe look upon your ſelves as deeply concern'd in the things you think of. Our minds dwell upon that whereof we apprehend an abſolute neceſſity. A condemned perſon would ſcarce think of any thing but procuring a reprieve, and his earneſtneſs for this would bar the door againſt other intruders.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be <hi>affectionate and practical.</hi> Meditation ſhould excite a ſpiritual delight in God, as it did in the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſa. 104.34.</hi> My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet: I will be glad in the Lord.</note>; and a divine delight would keep up good thoughts, and keep out impertinencies. A bare ſpeculation will tire the Soul, and without application, and preſſing upon the will and affections, will rather chill, than warm devotion. 'Tis only by this means, that we ſhall have the efficacy of truth in our wills, and the ſweetneſs in our affections, as well as the notion of it in our underſtandings. The more operative any truth is in this manner upon us, the leſs power will other thoughts have to interrupt, and the more diſdainfully will the heart look upon them, if they dare be impudent. Never therefore leave thinking of a ſpiritual ſubject, till your heart be affected with it. If you think of the evil of ſin, leave not till your heart loath it; if of God, ceaſe not till it mount up in admirations of him. If you think of his Mercy, melt for abuſing it; if of his Soveraignty, awe your heart into obedient reſolutions; if of his Preſence, double your watch over your ſelf. If you meditate on Chriſt, make no end till your hearts love him; if of his Death, plead the value of it for the juſtification of your perſons, and apply the vertue of it for the ſanctification of your natures. Without this practical ſtamp upon our affections, we ſhall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41445:9"/> have light ſpirits, while we have opportunity to converſe with the moſt ſerious objects. We often hear fooliſh thoughts breathing out themſelves in a houſe of mourning, in the midſt of Coffins, and trophies of death, as if men were confident they ſhould never die; whereas none are ſo ridiculous as to aſſert they ſhall live for ever. By this inſtance in a Truth ſo certainly aſſented to, we may judg of the neceſſity of this direction in truths more doubtfully believed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Draw ſpiritual Inferences from occaſional Objects. David</hi> did but wiſtly conſider the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.3, 4.</note> and he breaks out in ſelf-abaſement, and humble admirations of God. Glean matter of inſtruction to your ſelves, and praiſe to your Maker, from every thing you ſee: It will be a degree of reſtoration to a ſtate of innocency, ſince this was <hi>Adam</hi>'s task in Paradiſe. Dwell not upon any created object only as a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> to gratifie your rational curioſity, but as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> call Religion to the feaſt, and make a ſpiritual improvement. No creature can meet our eyes, but affords us leſſons worthy our thoughts, beſides the general notices of the power and wiſdom of the Creator. Thus may the Sheep read us a Lecture of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the Dove of innocence, the Ant and Bee raiſe bluſhes in us for our ſluggiſhneſs, and the ſtupid Oxe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> and dull Aſs correct and ſhame our ungrateful ignorance. And ſince our Saviour did ſet forth his own excellency in a ſenſible dreſs, the conſideration of thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors by an acute fancy, would garniſh out divine truths more deliciouſly, and conduct us into a more inward knowledge of the Myſteries of the Goſpel. He whoſe eyes are open, cannot want an inſtructer, unleſs he wants a heart. Thus may a Tradeſman ſpiritualize the matter he works upon, and make his commodities ſerve in wholſom meditations to his mind, and at once enrich both his Soul and his Coffers; yea, and in part reſtore the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the happineſs of anſwering a great end of their Creation, which Man depriv'd them of when he ſubjected them to vanity. Such a view of ſpiritual truths in ſenſible pictures would clear our knowledge, purifie our fancies, animate our affections, encourage our graces, diſgrace our vices, and both argue and ſhame us into duty; and thus take away all the cauſes of our wild wandring thoughts at once. And a frequent exerciſe of this method would beget and ſupport a habit of thinking well, and weaken, if not expel, a habit of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of directions are for the preventing bad thoughts. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>

'Tis <hi>Agur</hi>'s advice to be humbled particularly for evil thoughts. Frequent humiliations will deaden the fire within, and make the ſparks the fewer. The deeper the Plough ſinks, the more the weeds are killed, and the ground fitted for good grain. Men do not eaſily fall into thoſe ſins, for which they have been deeply humbled. Vain conceits love to reſide moſt in jolly hearts: but <hi>by the ſadneſs of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi>

Miſts and fogs are in the lower Region near the Earth, but reach not that next the Heavens. Were we free from earthly affections, theſe groſs vapours could not ſo eaſily diſturb our minds; but if the World once ſettle in our hearts, we ſhall never want the fumes of it to fill our heads. And as covetous deſires will ſtuff us with fooliſh imaginations, ſo they will ſmother any good thought caſt into us; as the <hi>thorns</hi> of worldly cares <hi>choak'd the good ſeed,</hi> and made it <hi>unfruitful,</hi> Matth. 13.22.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Avoid Idleneſs.</hi> Serious Callings do naturally compoſe mens ſpirits; but too much Recreation makes them blaze out in vanity.

Therefore when any ſinful motion ſteps in, double thy vigour about thy preſent buſineſs, and the fooliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent will ſneak out of thy heart at this diſcountenance. So true is that in this caſe, which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> falſly imagined in another, that the more we <hi>labour,</hi> the leſs we ſhall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vain words</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 5.9.</note>. As Satan is prevented by diligence in our Callings, ſo ſometimes the Spirit viſits us, and fills us with holy affections at ſuch ſeaſons; as Chriſt appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> and other Diſciples, when they were a fiſhing<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 21.3, 4.</note>; and uſually manifeſted his grace to men, when they were engaged in their uſeful buſineſſes, or religious ſervices. But theſe motions (as we may obſerve by the way) which come from the Spirit, are not to put us out of our way, but to aſſiſt us in our walking in it, and further us both in our attendance on, and ſucceſs in our duties. To this end look upon the work of your Callings as the work of God, which ought to be done in obedience to Him; as He hath ſet you to be uſeful in the community. Thus a holy exerciſe of our Callings would ſanctifie our minds, and by prepoſſeſſing them with ſolid buſineſs, we ſhould leave little room for any Spider to weave its Cobwebs.</p>

Bring every thought to the teſt of the Word. <hi>Aſaph</hi> had envious thoughts at the proſperity of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2, 3. which had almoſt tript him up, and laid him on his back.

Let us compare our thoughts with Scripture-rules. Comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, is the way to underſtand them; comparing ſpiritual ſins with ſpiritual commands, is the way to know them; and comparing ſpiritual vices with ſpiritual graces, is the way to loath them. Take not then any thing upon truſt from a crazy fancy: nor, without a ſcrutiny, believe that faculty, whereby dogs dream, and animals perform their natural exploits.</p>

               </note> We know not how big a ſmall motion, like a <hi>Crocodile</hi>'s egg, may grow, and how ravenous the breed may prove: it may, if entertain'd, force our Judgment, drag our Will, and make all our affections Bedlams. Beſides, ſince the Fancy is that Power in us upon which the Devil can immediately imprint his ſuggeſtions, and that we know not what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he hath to back any ſinful motion, if once the gate be ſet open; let us cruſh the brat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and fling the head over the wall to diſcourage the party.

There is not the moſt helliſh motion, but we may ſtrike ſome ſparks from it, to kindle our love to God, renew our repentance, raiſe our thankfulneſs, or quicken our obedience. Is it a blaſphemous motion againſt God? It gives you a juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thence to awe your heart into a deeper reverence of His Majeſty. Is it a luſtful thought? Open the floud-gates of your godly ſorrow, and groan for your original ſin. Is it a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41445:10"/> of your former ſin? Let it wind up your heart in the praiſes of him, who delivered you from it. Is it to tempt you from duty?

Reſolve to be a light ſhining the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in that darkneſs, and let it excite you to a cloſer adherence to him. Are they envious thoughts which ſteal upon you? Let thankfulneſs be the product, that you enjoy ſo much as you do, and more than you deſerve. Let Satan's fiery darts enflame your love rather than your Luſt, and like a skilful Pilot, make uſe of the violence of the winds, and raging of the Sea to further you in your ſpiritual voyage. This is to beat the Devil and our own hearts with their own weapons; who will have little ſtomach to fight with thoſe arms, wherewith they ſee themſelves wounded. There is not a remembrance of the worſt objects but may be improved to humility and thankfulneſs; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought of his old perſecuting, but he ſank down in humiliation, and mounted up in admirations of the riches of grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Continue your reſiſtance,</hi> if they ſtill importune thee; and lay not down thy weapons till they wholly ſhrink from thee.

Be as frequent in ſolliciting God, as they are in ſolliciting you: as they knock at your heart for entrance, ſo do you knock at heaven for aſſiſtance. And take this for your comfort, As the Devil takes their parts, ſo Chriſt will take yours at his Father's Throne; he that pray'd that the Devil might not winnow <hi>Peter</hi>'s faith, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede that your own heart may not winnow yours.

The very motion of your hearts heaven-ward at ſuch a time is a refuſal of the thought that preſſeth upon you, and will be ſo put upon your account.

            <p n="4">4. A fourth ſort of directions is concerning good motions; whether they ſpring natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a gracious principle, or are peculiarly breath'd in by the ſpirit. There are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bubblings of grace in a renewed mind, as there are of ſins in an unregenerate heart; for grace is as active a principle as any, becauſe 'tis a participation of the divine nature. But there are other thoughts darted in beyond the ordinary ſtrain of thinking: which like the beams of the Sun, evidence both themſelves and their original. And as concerning theſe motions joyn'd together, take theſe Directions in ſhort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Welcom and entertain them.</hi> As 'tis our happineſs, as well as our duty, to ſtifle evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſo 'tis our miſery, as well as our ſin, to extinguiſh heavenly.

               </note> muſt be kept alive by quickning meditation. When a holy thought lights ſuddenly upon you, which hath no connexion with any antecedent buſineſs in your mind (provided it be not unſeaſonable, nor hinder you from any abſolutely neceſſary duty either of religion, or your calling) receive it as a meſſenger from heaven: and the rather becauſe 'tis a ſtranger. You know not but you may entertain an Angel, yea, ſomething greater than an Angel, even the Holy Ghoſt. Open all the powers of your ſouls, like ſo many Organ-pipes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the breath of this Spirit when he blows upon you. 'Tis a ſign of an agreeableneſs between the heart and heaven, when we cloſe with, and preſerve ſpiritual motions. We need not ſtand long to examine them: they are evident by their holineſs, ſweetneſs, and ſpirituality. We may as eaſily diſcern them, as we can exotick plants from thoſe that grow naturally in our own ſoil: or as a palate at the firſt taſt can diſtinguiſh between a rich and generous wine, and a rough water. The thoughts inſtill'd by the Spirit of adoption are not violent, tumultuous, full of perturbation: but, like himſelf, gentle and dove-like ſolicitings,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> warm and holy impulſes, and (when cheriſhed) leave the ſoul in a more humble, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pure, and believing temper than they found it. 'Tis a high aggravation of ſin to <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7.51. Yet we may quench his motions by neglect, as well as by oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by that means loſe both the profit and pleaſure, which would have attended the entertainment. Salvation came both to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe and heart, upon embracing the firſt motion our Saviour was pleaſed to make him; Had he ſlighted that, 'tis uncertain whether another ſhould have been beſtowed upon him. The more ſuch ſprouts are plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41445:11"/> and nouriſhed in us, the leſs room will ſtinking weeds have to root themſelves, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe their influence. And for thy own good thoughts, feed them and keep them alive, that they may not be like a blaze of ſtraw which takes birth, and expires the ſame minute. Brood upon them, and kill them not, as ſome birds do their young ones, by too often fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their neſts. <hi>David</hi> kept up a ſtaple of ſound and good thoughts: he would ſcarce elſe have deſired God <hi>to try and know them,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Improve them</hi> for thoſe ends, to which they naturally tend. 'Tis not enough to give them a bare reception, and forbear the ſmothering of them; but we muſt conſider what affections are proper to be rais'd by them, either in the ſearch of ſome truth, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome duty. Thoſe gleams, with ſhoot into us on the ſudden, have ſome leſſon ſeal'd up in them, to be opened, and learned by us. When <hi>Peter</hi> upon the crowing of the cock call'd to mind his Maſter's admonition, <hi>he thought thereon and wept:</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Mar. 14 72.</note> he did not only receive the ſpark, but kindled a ſuitable affection. A choice graff, though kept very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by us, yet if not preſently ſet, will wither, and diſappoint our expectation of the deſired fruit. No man is without ſome ſecret whiſpers to diſſwade him from ſome alluring and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſin<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Job 33.14, 17.</hi> God ſpeaks once, yea, twice, that he may withdraw man from his purpoſe.</note>; as <hi>Cain</hi> had by an audible voice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. which had he obſerved to the damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the revengeful motion againſt his brother, he had prevented his brother's death, his own deſpair, and eternal ruin.

Let our motion be quick in any duty which the Spirit doth ſuggeſt; and while he heaves our hearts, and oyls our wheels, we ſhall do more in any religious ſervice, and that more pleaſantly and ſucceſsfully, than at another time with all our own art and induſtry; for his injections are like water poured into a pump to raiſe up more; and as Satan's motions are not without a main body to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond them, ſo neither do the Spirit's go unattended, without a ſufficient ſtrength to aſſiſt the entertainers of them. Well then, lye not at anchor, when a freſh gale would fill thy ſails, but lay hold of the preſent opportunity. Theſe ſeaſons are often like thoſe influences from certain conjunctions of the Planets, which if not (according to the Aſtrologer's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) preſently applied, paſs away, and return not again in many ages: So the Spirit's breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are often determined, that if they be not entertained with ſuitable affections, the time will be unregainable, and the ſame gracious opportunities of a ſweet entercourſe may be for ever loſt; for God will not have his holy Spirit diſhonoured <hi>in always ſtriving</hi> with wilful man.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> When <hi>Judas</hi> neglected our Saviour's advertiſement, <hi>John</hi> 13.21. the Devil quickly enters and hurries him to the execution of his traiterous project, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and he never meets with any motion afterwards, but from his new Maſter, and that eternally fatal both to his body and ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Refer them,</hi> if poſſible, <hi>to aſſiſt your Morning Meditation;</hi> that like little Brooks ariſing from ſeveral Springs, they may meet in one channel, and compoſe a more uſeful Stream. What ſtraggling good thoughts ariſe, though they may owe their birth to ſeveral occaſions, and tend divers ways, yet liſt them in the ſervice of that truth, to which you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the government of your mind that day: As Conſtables in a time of neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the King take up men that are going about their honeſt and lawful occaſions, and force them to joyn in one employ for the publick Service. Many accidental glances (as was obſerved before) will ſerve both to fix and illuſtrate your Morning Propoſition. But if it be an extraordinary injection, and cannot be referred to your ſtanding <hi>Theſis,</hi> follow it, and let your thoughts run whither it will lead you: A Theme of the Spirit's ſetting is better than one of our own chuſing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Record the choicer of them.</hi> We may have occaſion to look back upon them another time, either as grounds of comfort in ſome hour of temptation, or directions in ſome ſudden emergency; but conſtantly as perſuaſive engagements to our neceſſary duty. Thus they may lye by us for further uſe, as money in our purſe. Since <hi>Mary</hi> kept and ponder'd the ſhort ſayings of our Saviour in <hi>her heart,</hi>

            <p>THE Author of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the time when it was penn'd, are uncertain. Some think it was compos'd after the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon the Erection of the ſecond Temple, and deſigned to be ſung in their conſtant Publick Aſſemblies. Others think it was compos'd by <hi>David,</hi> when he brought the Ark to <hi>Sion,</hi> as the Repoſitory for it, till the Building of the Temple, wherein it might honourably reſt. It ſeems, whoever was the Author, to be Ecſtatical. The Penman breaks out into a holy rapture and admiration of the firmneſs and ſtability of the Church. 'Tis alſo Prophetical of the Chriſtian Church, of the glory of it, the largeneſs of its bounds, and perpetual duration. The <hi>Jews</hi> ridiculouſly interpret it of literal <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in regard of the excellency of its Climate, the goodneſs of the air, being ſeated in the middle or navel of the earth, and the ſeat and ſpring of all the wiſe men, accounting all fools that were to be found in other parts; 'tis true, others were not wiſe with a wiſdom to Salvation; they were not inſtructed in the high Myſteries of Religion by God, as thoſe People were. But was there not Learning among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp; Wiſdom among the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and a ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Mechanick Arts among the <hi>Tyrians</hi> which lived in the ſame Climate with the <hi>Jews?</hi> It can by no means be underſtood of the material <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Sion;</hi> that was ruin'd by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and tho re-edified, yet afterwards ſubverted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of it at this day become a Stable for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the bringing in thoſe Nations mention'd, <hi>v.</hi> 4. overthrows any ſuch interpretation, which never were inrol'd in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of <hi>Sion,</hi> nor became Votaries to the true Religion, while the walls of that place were ſtanding in their glory. <hi>Sion</hi> was the place whence <hi>the Law</hi> was to come, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.2. a Law of another nature, than that which was uttered with Thunders from Mount <hi>Sinai.

It was upon <hi>Moriah</hi> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was deſigned for a Sacrifice, and the moſt ſignal act of obedience performed to God by the Father of the Faithful. It was there alſo that <hi>David</hi> appeaſed the wrath of God, by Sacrifice, after it had iſſued out upon the People in a Plague, for the numbring of them: And the very name <hi>Moriah</hi> hath ſomething ſacred in it, it ſignifying either <hi>God teaching,</hi> or <hi>God manifeſted;</hi> which name might be given it by God, with reſpect to the manifeſtation of Chriſt who was to come, during the ſtanding of the ſecond Temple.</p>

It was in this Goſpel-Church, the true <hi>Sion,</hi> that he <hi>deſired to dwell,</hi> and will <hi>remain for ever, Pſal.</hi> 68.17.

None ſhall enter in to deface it, none ſhall preſcribe new laws to it, none ſhall trample upon it; when God enters into the Chriſtian Church, he ſhuts the door after him, his preſence never departs from it, his Goſpel ſhall never be rooted out of it, the Church hath a ſecurity in its foundation as being <hi>built upon a rock,</hi> Mat. 18.16. It hath an aſſurance of preſervation by the preſence of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt in the midſt of her,</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſtability muſt not be meant of any particular Church in the world.</hi> Particular Churches have their beginnings, progreſſes, and periods; many Churches as well as many perſons have apoſtatized from the faith; many Candleſticks have been broken in pieces, and yet the candle not blown out, but remov'd and ſet in another ſocket; particular Churches have been corrupted by <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> rent by <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and ſcattered by <hi>Perſecutions.</hi> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains are there of thoſe ſeven <hi>Churches in Aſia</hi> which were the <hi>walk of Chriſt,</hi> Revel. 2.1. but deplorable ruines? There is no abſolute promiſe given to any particular Church, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41445:14"/> it ſhall be free from defection. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo flouriſhing in the Apoſtles time, was warn'd to be humble, leſt it became as much Apoſtate as that of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21, 22. Nay there are predictions of almoſt an univerſal apoſtacy<note place="margin">All the world wondred after the Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 13.3.</hi> and worſhiped him, <hi>v. 8.</hi>
               </note>. And juſt before the coming of Chriſt it will be difficult to find a <hi>grain</hi> of faith among the multitude of <hi>Chaff, Luk.</hi> 18.8. There is not one place which was in the primitive times dignified with truth, but is now deformed by error. Yea the univerſal Church hath been forced by the fury of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> though not to ſink yet to fly into the wilderneſs &amp; obſcurity, yet hath been preſerv'd through all changes in the midſt of thoſe deſolations &amp; deſerts. 'Tis not indeed ſo fixed in one place but the cords may be taken up, the ſtakes removed, and the tents pitched in another ground. 'Tis ſpread through the world wherever God will ſet up the light of his Goſpel. <hi>Sion</hi> hath ſtood, though ſome Synagogues of it have been pulled down; it hath like the Sun kept its ſtation in the Firmament, though not without eclipſes and clouds to muffle it. The Church is but one, though it be in divers Countries, and nam'd according to the places where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> &amp;c. which all are as the beams of the Sun darted from one body, branches growing from one root, ſtreams flowing from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; if you obſtruct the light of one beam, or lop off one branch, or dam up the ſtream, yet the Sun, Root, Fountain remains the ſame: So though the light of particular Churches may be dim and extinguiſht, the beauty of them defaced, yet the univerſal Church, that which is properly <hi>Sion</hi> remains the ſame, it remains upon Chriſt the rock, and is ſtill upon the <hi>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When a people have forfeited their Church priviledges by barrenneſs, and wantonneſs, and God in juſtice ſtrips them of their Ornaments, he will have another people which he will form for his glory, and fit for his reſidence; the Goſpel ſhall never want an hoſt to entertain it, nor a ground to be made fruitful by it<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. 21.43.</hi> The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruits thereof.</note>. The Kingdom of God is not deſtroyed when it is removed, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into a more fruitful Soil. While Chriſt hath a body in the world, he will find a <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> to embalm it, and preſerve it for a reſurrection. When the glory of the Lord goes off from one Cherub, it will find other <hi>Cherubims</hi> whereon to ſettle, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.4.18. That glory which had dwelt is the material ark of the Sanctuary, departs from thence to find a Throne in that <hi>Chariot</hi> which had been deſcribed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. Nay the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God from one Church renders his name more glorious in another<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rivet.</hi> in Hoſ. 1.10. p. 518.</note>. The rejection of the <hi>carnal Iſrael</hi> was the Preamble to the appearance of the <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> &amp; the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was rendred more large and illuſtrious by the diſſolving of that Church that had confidence in the fleſh, truſted in their external rites and patcht the beauty and purity of divine Worſhip with their whoriſh additions; juſt as the mortification of the fleſh gives livelineſs to the ſpirit, and the pulling up noyſom weeds from a garden makes room for the ſetting and flouriſhing growth of good plants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though God unſtakes the Church in one place, yet he will not only have a Church, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Church in another. It ſhall be ſaid of</hi> Sion, <hi>This and that man was born there.</hi> It ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Sion by God;</hi> It ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Sion by men.</hi> If Chriſt confeſſeth none before his Father, but ſuch as <hi>confeſs him before men, Luk.</hi> 12.8. ſhall he ever want imployment? ſhall the world ever be at that paſs as to bear none that profeſs him? and ſo none to be owned by him at the right hand of his Father? Shall he by whom all things ſubſiſt, have none to acknowledg their ſubſiſtance by him? The world may be the Inheritance of Chriſt, but ſcarce counted his poſſeſſion, if there were not in ſome parts of it a body of ſubjects to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Allegiance to him in the face of a perſecuting generation. Indeed when the Church was confined to the narrow limits of the <hi>carnal Iſrael,</hi> the profeſſion of the truth was contracted to a few, though the faith of it might be alive in others; only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> among the whole body of the murmuring Iſraelites in the wilderneſs aſſerted the honour of God, and maintained the truth of his promiſe, though the belief of it might ſparkle in the hearts of others under the aſhes of their fears, that hindered their diſcovery of it to others. It was another time reduced to one, and <hi>Elijah</hi> only had the boldneſs to make a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of God, though there were 7000 who had retain'd their purity while they had loſt their courage to publiſh it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. But in the Chriſtian Church, ſince the number of elect are more, the profeſſion will be greater in the midſt of an univerſal Apoſtacy of pretenders, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>All that dwell upon the earth ſhall Worſhip him, i. e.</hi> the Beaſt, <hi>whoſe names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.</hi> If their election be a preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an adoration of the Beaſt, it is alſo a ſecurity againſt the denial of any ſuch worſhip; and an encouragement to profeſs the name of Chriſt, when they ſhall be brought upon the ſtage.</p>
            <p>This profeſſion may lye much in the dark, and not be ſo viſible as before; As a field of corn overtopt by weeds looks at a diſtance, as if there were nothing elſe but the blew and red cockle and darnel, but when we come near we ſee the good grain ſhews its head as well as the weeds; but a profeſſing people there will be one where or other. 'Tis a ſtanding law of Chriſtianity, that a <hi>belief in the heart</hi> ſhould be attended by <hi>confeſſion with the mouth,</hi> Rom. 10.9. And the Church is a congregation of people ſounding the voice of Chriſt, as he was preached and confeſt by the Apoſtles; while there are believers, there will be profeſſors in Society together; ſome Ordinances ſetled in being, during the continuance of the world; as the <hi>Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.6. implies a Society, as the ſeat of the adminiſtration; <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is a Ceremony of admiſſion into a Society; the <hi>Supper</hi> a feaſting of ſeveral upon ſpiritual Viands.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41445:14"/> Officers appointed imply a body profeſſing ſome rules, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. To what purpoſe are all theſe ſetled during the continuance of the world, if they were not ſomewhere to be practiſed till that period of time; &amp; how can they be practiſed without a Confederation and Society? Without ſuch a body all the Ordinances and Rules of Chriſt would be in vain, and imply as little wiſdom in enacting them, as a want of power in not keeping up a Society in ſome part of the world to obſerve them according to his own preſcriptions. There will therefore be in ſome part or other of the world a Church openly profeſſing the doctrine of truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Church</hi> or <hi>Sion ſhall have a numerous progeny.</hi> The <hi>Spiritual Iſrael</hi> ſhall be <hi>as the Sand of the Sea, which cannot be meaſured or numbred, Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. which was the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.17. and renewed in the ſame terms to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.12. The Church is a little flock in compariſon of the carnal world, yet it is numerous in it ſelf, though not in every place; for ſometimes there may not be above <hi>three</hi> found to withſtand the worſhip of a Golden Image; yet in ſome one or other place of the world, and ſucceſſively it ſhall be numerous; he will not loſe the honour of the feaſt he hath prepared, though thoſe that are invited prefer their Farms and Oxen before it, but will find Gueſts in the high-ways; he will ſpread his wings from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in every place <hi>Incenſe ſhall be offered to his Name, Mal.</hi> 1.11. The Church is compared to the <hi>morning, Cant.</hi> 6.10. which from ſmall beginnings in a ſhort time fills the whole Hemiſphere with light; and the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it run all that <hi>way.</hi> The <hi>Hills</hi> were to be <hi>covered with the ſhadow</hi> of it; her <hi>boughs are to be ſent out to the Sea, and her branches to the River, Pſal.</hi> 80.10, 11. It was to ſpread it ſelf like a <hi>goodly Cedar,</hi> and be a <hi>dwelling-place to the Fowl of every wing, Ezek.</hi> 17.23. Yea, a numberleſs multitude from all Nations, Kindreds, People and Tongues, are to ſtand before the Throne, and before the Lamb, <hi>Clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands, Rev.</hi> 7.9. adorned with innocency, and crowned with victory. No Monarchy ever did, ever can ſo far ſtretch her bounds; nor hath the Sun ſeen any place where it hath not ſeen ſome ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Church. Every Kingdom hath met with unpaſſable bounds; but the Enſigns of Chriſt have not been limited. The Church was once crowded up in a narrow compaſs of <hi>Judaea;</hi> but ſince that her Territories are enlarged, her Enſigns have flouriſhed over many Countries, <hi>Rahab, Tyre, Ethiopia,</hi> the vaſt circuit of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the deſerts of <hi>Africa,</hi> have been added to her Empire; her Progeny ſhall be hereafter as numerous as it hath been; when the devices of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall be more ſeen and perceived, they will be more nauſeated, and many with <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi>

The proſperity of worldly Kingdoms is no better than a fire of ſtraw that blazeth and vaniſheth, it hath but the brittle foundation of humane Policy, and an eſtabliſhment by a temporary Providence; the everlaſting Covenant, and the Baſis of Divine Truth and Love cannot be claimed by any but the Church; not a Kingdom can be pitched upon in all the Records of Hiſtory, that hath maintain'd its ſtanding, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over its enemies, and ſubſiſted at ſuch a rate, and by unuſual and unheard of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, as the Church hath done. Thoſe that have been beſt guarded by Laws, hedg'd in with the beſt Methods of Government, and arm'd with a ſtrong power to protect them, have found ſomething or other riſing from their own bowels, or their enemies Power to procure their diſſolution. But the Church, though daſht againſt ſo many Rocks, has yet floated above the deluge of thoſe Commotions that have ſunk other Societies. The Kings of the world could never yet boaſt of a full Conqueſt of her, or brag that ſhe hath been ſubjected to the ſame condition with themſelves; ſhe hath born up her head in the midſt of earthly Revolutions, and met with her preſervation or reſurrection, where carnal Intereſts have found their Funeral. Thoſe that have ſet their feet upon the Churches breaſts, or ſpilt her blood, have found their poiſon where they imagin'd they ſhould find their ſafety. The <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Empire, which was God's Rod for the correcting his People, ſaw her ſelf in the chains of her Enemies that night ſhe had been ſacrilegiouſly carouzing healths in the <hi>ſacred Veſſels of the Temple, Dan.</hi> 5.3, 30.

She hath been preſerved in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting world in ſpight of the enmity of it, by a Divine Wiſdom that hath not regulated it ſelf by the Methods of fleſh and blood. His feeding the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs was a figure of what he would do to his Church, and he hath accompliſht it to the Goſpel-Church, as really as he did to the ancient <hi>Iſrael.</hi> While ſhe hath been in a wilderneſs theſe 1200 <hi>years,</hi> and I hope ſomewhat upwards, ſhe hath not wanted her <hi>Manna,</hi> nor her <hi>Rock;</hi> ſhe hath been fed in her ſtraits, and preſerved in her combates; and as Chriſt <hi>reigns,</hi> ſo the Church <hi>lives,</hi> and hath her <hi>Table ſpread in the midſt of her Enemies.</hi> What is 1100 <hi>years</hi> continuance of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Government, to ſo many thouſand years preſervation of the Church in the midſt of <hi>Atheiſm, Paganiſm, Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> ever ſince it was firſt born and nurſt in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family; and this hath been, when her friends have forſaken her; when her enemies have been confident of her ruine; when her ſelf hath expected little elſe than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; when ſhe hath thought ſometimes in her ſtraits, her God ignorant of her; when Hell hath poured out a flood, the <hi>carnal Earth</hi> hath ſometimes found it their Intereſt to help her, though their enmity were irreconcileable againſt her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.16. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and power of her Enemies, that have found ſucceſs in their other projects, have met with an unforeſeen baffle, when they have armed againſt her. Men of the greateſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have proved fools, when they have exerciſed their wit againſt her. <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s wiſdom was great when on <hi>David</hi>'s ſide, and changed to folly when he ſhifted ſides againſt him. A ſecret blaſt hath been upon the Projects of men, when they have turned againſt her upon ſecular Intereſts. In the greateſt Judgments which have come, and ſhall come upon the world, when wonders ſhall be ſhewn in the Heavens, and in the Earth, blood, fire, and pillars of ſmoke; when the <hi>Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood, Joel</hi> 2.30, 31. yet God will have a Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Some that <hi>call upon his Name,</hi> v. 32.

And though one generation paſs, and another comes, he is the ſame dwelling-place, and never out of repair, never will want repair; and therefore it is an aſtoniſhment, that the Devil after ſo long an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould be ſuch a fool as to engage in new attempts, when he hath found ſo little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in his former, and hath had ſo many Ages to witneſs the baffles he hath received, what a fool is he to think that her Defender ſhould be conquered by a revolted Angel, that lies under an everlaſting curſe!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The violences againſt her, which have been fatal to other Societies, have been uſeful to her.</hi> This buſh hath burned without conſuming, and preſerved its verdure in the midſt of fire, not from the nature of the buſh, but the preſence of him that dwelt in it: It hath not only ſubſiſted in the bowels of her Enemies, but hath been eſtabliſhed by means of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of men, and grown greater in the midſt of torments and death; ſhe hath not only out-grown her afflictions, but grown greater and better by them.

Though it be cut, the cutting hath contributed to its thriving. This Roſe-buſh hath not only ſtood in the wind, which hath rooted up other Oaks, but the fragrancy of it hath been carried by that wind to places at a greater diſtance. When <hi>Antiochus</hi> commanded all

Truth hath been often rendred by ſuch proceedings more clear and glorious. The perſecution of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Head, the Captain of our Salvation, to death, was the occaſion of the diſcovery of the Goſpel to the whole world; he was the great ſeed, that being caſt into the ground became ſo <hi>fruitful,</hi> as to ſpread his branches in all corners of the Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.24. And that perſecution which I ſuppoſe remains yet to be acted, and which will be the ſmarteſt, ſhall be ſucceeded by the cleareſt eruption of Goſpel-light, wherein the Goſpel ſhall recover its ancient and primitive glory.

Could the bare creation ſhew to man ſo much as his back parts? The moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perfections of his Nature could never be viſible in a handful of creatures, though never ſo glorious, no nor in multitudes of worlds of a more beautiful aſpect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcovery of the Goſpel, and the ſetling a Goſpel Church. How ſhould we have known his patience, been inſtructed in his mercy, have had any ſenſe of his grace, or underſtood the depths of his wiſdom or heard the voice of the bowels of his love, ſo as they are linkt together in his nature? If God created the world for his glory, he created it for his higheſt glory; a bare creation without a redeemed company of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, could never have given us a proſpect of the great glory of his Nature, nor have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the end of God, which was the manifeſtation of his perfections. His wiſdom broke out in the frame of all creatures giving them life and motion; but his eye, when he made the world, was upon the manifeſtation of a greater wiſdom which then lay <hi>hid</hi> in his boſom, and was not to be diſcovered but in the publiſhing the Goſpel. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.9.10. The wiſdom that broke out in the creation, was but a ſcaffold, whereon in time his wiſdom in the glory of a Church peculiar to himſelf ſhould appear. All things were created for Chriſt as well as by him, for him and his glory as Mediator and as Head of the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the glory of his body. And his end in ſending Chriſt was to <hi>gather all things together in him;</hi> thoſe things which are <hi>in Heaven</hi> as well as thoſe which are <hi>on earth,</hi> Eph. 1.10.

He pickt out the weakeſt, pooreſt perſons as the matter of it, that he might ſhew his own honour in preſerving it: he hath yet ſupported her all the while ſhe hath carryed the croſs of her Lord: he hath ſent his ſpirit to frame a ſucceſſion of new materials for her: how fruitleſs would all this be, if he ſhould let Hell waſte the <hi>Temple</hi> erected for Heaven? What? did he gather and enlarge the Church only to make it a richer conqueſt, and a fatter morſel for the Devil? How vain would his former kindneſs appear, if he ſhould let it utterly ſink as long as the world endures? It cannot be imagin'd with any ſemblance of reaſon, that God hath taken all this care about the nurſing and growth of the Church from ſmall beginnings, to let his darling be a prey to the mouth of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and be of no other uſe than to fatten his enemies.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>In regard of the coſt and pains he hath been at about Sion.</hi> Did the creation of the world ever coſt him ſo much? Was there one tear, one groan, one ſigh, much leſs the blood of the Son of God expended in laying the foundation of it? When the matter of it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void, the beauty of it was not wrought with a waſhing with blood. When God eſtabliſhed the clouds above, and ſtrengthn'd the foundations of the deep, when he gave the ſea his decree, and appointed the foundations of the earth, the Son of God was by him <hi>rejoicing</hi> in the habitable parts of the earth and his <hi>delights</hi> were among the ſons of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.28, 29, 31. Not <hi>bleeding</hi> and <hi>dying.</hi> But this he muſt do, he muſt take humane nature, be bruiſed in his heel by the ſerpent, and be a Sacrifice himſelf, make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, before a ſtone for the building of ſpiritual <hi>Sion</hi> could be fram'd and laid.</p>
            <p>What pains have been taken alſo in the effecting it? The birth of the Church was a work of greater power than the fabrick of the world; a few words went to the rearing of that; in the revolution of ſix days it was ſet upon its feet: but many a year was God in travel before <hi>Sion</hi> was brought forth; there was an enemy as potent as Hell to deal with in ſetting it in <hi>Adams</hi> family after mans Apoſtacy: The corrupt nature, that had then got the poſſeſſion of the world, to conteſt with. The world muſt be drowned to bring it to a ſecond nativity and eſtabliſhment in <hi>Noah.</hi> The forming the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was not without ſome pangs of nature; what ſigns and wonders, and great terrours were wrought in its bringing forth out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſtriking off the chains of her Captivity? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.34. What <hi>fire, blackneſs, darkneſs, tempeſt,</hi> that made a convulſion in the Souls of thoſe that were to be her materials? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18, 19. And the bringing forth the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, and enlarging the cords and ſtakes of <hi>Sion,</hi> was preceded by the darkening the Sun, the trembling of the Earth, the opening of the Graves, the ſuffering of that which was deareſt to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>No Power was ever employed ſo ſignally in the Affairs of any worldly concern, as in the ſettlement of <hi>Sion.</hi> The devouring waves of the Red Sea have been made her Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and the Sand, the Grave of her Enemies, hath been a path for her paſſage. The <hi>Sun</hi> hath forgotten his natural Race, to gaze upon her Victories, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Angels</hi> have been commiſſioned to be her Champions, and fight her Battels, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. The whole Hoſt of Heaven have been arrayed to fight for <hi>Sion</hi> on Earth. The mercileſs nature of the fire hath been curb'd, to preſerve her children, when ſhe ſeemed to be reduced to a ſmall number; and the mouths of hunger-ſtarv'd <hi>Lions</hi> have been bridled for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22. The proudeſt Enemies to her have been vanquiſht by <hi>Frogs,</hi> and <hi>Lice;</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> that would lay their hands upon her, have been made to their diſgrace a living Banquet for Worms the vileſt creatures, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.23.</p>
            <p>And indeed, after the malice of the Devil had uſurpt God's right in the Creation, and had drawn the chiefeſt of his ſublunary creatures into an Apoſtacy with himſelf, no leſs than an Infinite Power could be engaged againſt the greateſt of created Powers, if God would not forego his own honour in ſuffering himſelf to be deprived of the fruit of his works. No leſs than Infinite Power could erect a Church in the world; that God might have the fruit of his Creation, he ordered this Power to appear, ſtruck down the Gates of Hell, ſent his Son to reſcue his Honour, and his Spirit to poliſh ſtones for his Temple. Every one that is fitted for this Building, had Almightineſs at work with him <hi>before he was form'd, Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. Every ſtone was hewed by the Spirit, and the Image of God was imprinted by a Divine Efficacy. Shall the fruit of ſo much Power, and the mark of his own Image, want an eſtabliſhment, God would ſeem to be careleſs of the Treaſures of his own Nature, wherewith he hath endow'd her. Shall all this coſt and pains be to no purpoſe? Were the Gates of Hell taken down to be ſet up again more ſtrongly? and the charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counſels of God to be puft away by the breath of Satan? Doth it conſiſt with his Wiſdom to let <hi>Sion</hi> fall out of his hands into the power of her old Oppreſſor? Men are more deſirous to preſerve the Eſtate they have gotten by ſweat, than that which is left them by Inheritance; and are moſt careful in ſettling that which hath coſt them more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and more Labour. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſets a value upon the Portion he got with his <hi>Sword</hi> and

As husbandmen ſow their Fields for their own uſe, to reap from them a fruitful crop; and therefore till the Harveſt be in, they take care to make up the breaches, and preſerve them from the Incurſions of beaſts. Though God hath an objective glory from all creatures, yet he hath an active glory only from the Church. 'Tis <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>houſe of Aaron,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that fear the Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> calls upon to render God the praiſe of the <hi>eternity of his mercy, Pſal.</hi> 118.2, 3, 4.

There cannot be a glory to God in the Church throughout all Ages, without the continuance of the Church in all Ages. God will have a revenue of glory paid him during the continuance of the world; there ſhall therefore be a ſtanding Church during the duration of the world; while he therefore expects a <hi>glory</hi> from the <hi>midſt</hi> of his People, he will be a <hi>wall of fire round about them,</hi> and keep <hi>Sion</hi> one where or other in a poſture to glorifie him. What is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> motive to this glory? 'Tis not a remote power, ſuch as can act, but will not; but a power operative in the Church, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things for her, which ſhe could never ask, nor think for her ſelf<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>v. 20.</hi> Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundan ly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that we ask or think, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power that works in us.</note>. God hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory from the Church, than he can have from the world; he therefore gives her more <hi>ſignal</hi> experiments of his Power, Wiſdom and Love, than to the reſt of the world. He had a glory from Angels, but only as Creator, not as Redeemer, till they were acquainted with his deſign, and were ſpeculators of his actions in gathering a Church in the world. The Church therefore was the original of the new glory, and praiſe, the Angels preſented to God. <hi>Glory in the Church by Chriſt. Muſculus</hi> thinks that is added to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which was ſettled by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as much as to ſay, God had not ſo much glory by the Tabernacles of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as he hath by the Church as ſettled by Chriſt. Or, <hi>by Chriſt</hi> notes the manner of the preſenting our praiſe, and the ground of the acceptance of our praiſe. God accepts no glory but what is offered to him by the hand of Chriſt; and Chriſt preſents no glory but what is paid him by the Church. 'Tis the Church then, and the Goſpel-Church that preſerves the glory of God in the world. If the Church therefore ceaſeth, the glory of God in the world ceaſeth. But ſince God hath created all for his own glory, ſeparated a Church out of the world for his glory, appointed his Son the Head of it, that he might be glorified, his Church therefore is as dear to him as his glory, and dear to him in order to his glory; in eſtabliſhing it therefore he eſtabliſhes his own honour and name. It ſhall therefore remain in this world to glorifie him, afterwards in another to glorifie him, and be glorified by him.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) In regard that <hi>'tis the object of his peculiar affection.</hi> Eſtabliſhment of a beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is inſeparable from a real affection.

Not only ask of me what you want, but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> me in the things that are to come; the pleas of my promiſes of things to come, and your deſires to bring them forth as the work of my hand, ſhall be as powerful a motive to me, as a command from a Superiour is to an obedient Inferiour; for it is to <hi>things to come,</hi> ſuch things that God hath predicted, that he limits their asking, which he calls alſo here a commanding of him. There was a real love in the firſt choice; there is an intenſeneſs of love in the firſt attraction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> His love, which had a being from Eternity, is expreſt by words of more tenderneſs, when he comes to frame her; <hi>lovingkindneſs;</hi> as if his affection ſeemed to be increaſed, when he came to the execution of his Counſel.

Men are concern'd in honour for that upon which they have plac'd their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41445:18"/> of good will to <hi>Sion</hi> to frame her, to pick out her materials when they lay like Swine in the confuſed maſs, and dirty mire of a corrupt world? Is there not alſo a love of delight, ſince he hath refined and beautified her by imparting to her of his <hi>own comlineſs, Ezek.</hi> 16.14. Is it likely this affection ſhould ſink into careleſneſs? And the fruit of ſo much love be daſht in peices? Can ſuch tenderneſs be ſo unconcerned, as to let the apple of his eye be pluckt out? To be a lazy ſpectator of the pillage of his Jewels by the powers of Hell? to have the Center of his delight toſt about at the pleaſure of men and Devils? Shall a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be careleſs of her ſucking Child? How then can that God, whoſe tenderneſs to the Church, cannot be equalled by the bowels of the moſt compaſſionate mother to her infants? Surely God is concerned in honour, to maintain againſt a feeble Devil, and a decrepit world, that which is the object of his almighty affection.</p>

The powers of the world have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the Churches enemies; the wiſe have ſet their reaſon, and the mighty their arms againſt her; the Devil, the God of this world, is ſo far from being her friend, that <hi>Sion</hi> hath been the only object of his ſpite. He contrives only floods to drown her, or mines to demoliſh her. Her own friends are often ſo darkened, or divided, that they cannot ſome times for Ignorance, and will not other times for peeviſhneſs hit upon, and uſe the right means for her preſervation. 'Tis an honourable thing then for that God, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles himſelf <hi>the Father of the fatherleſs,</hi> to ſhew his own power and grace in her eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And ſince God was pleaſed to take this courſe rather than create a new world, and hath laid the foundation of a new Kingdom by drawing ſome out of that common rebellion, the humane nature was fallen into, and that he might do it with honour to himſelf, hath ſent his Son upon that errand, by his blood to bring back man to God, and his ſpirit to make men fit for a Communion with him, and hath backt his affection to the Church with ſo much coſt and pains for her welfare; If after all this God ſhould-deſert his Church, the diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Gods wiſdom, the loſs of the fruit of all his coſt and pains, the weakneſs of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of his power to perform his promiſe, and the ruin of his glory intended by thoſe methods, would be the iſſue, which would be attended with the triumph of his revolted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and greateſt enemy.

If there were no Church preſerv'd in the world, he would be a nominal Prophet without any diſciples, a King without ſubjects, and a Prieſt without ſuppliants to be atoned by him, upon earth. Now Chriſt is the <hi>wonderfull Counſellour, the everlaſting Father,</hi> and <hi>the Government is</hi> laid <hi>upon his Shoulders;</hi> to what end? to <hi>order</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> the Kingdom of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. All the ſtrength and vigor he had, as it was <hi>from God,</hi> ſo it was intended <hi>for God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Thou madeſt the Son of man ſtrong for thy ſelf, <hi>Pſa. 80.17.</hi>
               </note>. And the reaſon is, becauſe, though God hath given up the adminiſtration of things to Chriſt, yet he hath not deveſted himſelf of his right, nor can; For God is the chief Lord, and the relation of creatures not ceaſing, the relation of Lord and Creator cannot ceaſe. And therefore ſince the right of God continues, the grant of the uttermoſt ends of the earth to be the inheritance &amp; poſſeſſion of Chriſt, includes not only a gift but an Office, to preſerve, protect, eſtabliſh, and improve his poſſeſſion for thoſe ends for which he had the grant, and to prevent all that may impair it. As he had a right and ſtrength, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God to rear it, ſo he hath an Office and Power to eſtabliſh it, as well as to erect it, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>the ſame</hi> in all his offices <hi>yeſterday, to day and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.8. The ſame in credit with God, in faithfulneſs to his Office, the vertue of his blood, the force of his arm, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions to bleeding <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>'Tis his part, as a Prophet, to eſtabliſh it in Doctrine.</hi> 'Tis his part <hi>externally</hi> to raiſe his truth when it lyes gaſping in the rubbiſh of errour, and refine his worſhip when it is daub'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41445:19"/> with Superſtition and Idolatry. <hi>Internally</hi> to clear the underſtanding to know his truth, quicken the will to imbrace it, rivet the word in the conſcience, and enflame the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love and delight in it. Certainly the promiſe of the abiding of his Spirit implies the efficacy of his operation while he abides. He is to provide againſt the ſubtilty and rapine of fox like Hereticks, that they ſpoil not the <hi>tender vine, Cant.</hi> 2.15. And to furniſh the Church with gifts for the preſerving and increaſing her. The perpetual exerciſe of this prophetical office he promiſed them, when he gave the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> a Charter for his preſence <hi>to the end of the world, Mat.</hi> 28.20. Which was in relation to their miniſtry and their office of teaching. Since he promiſed his preſence with his miniſtry to the end of the world, he will have a Church to the end of the world, to enjoy the benefit of that promiſe to be taught by them. It conſiſted not with the wiſdom or faithfulneſs of Chriſt to promiſe a perpetuity to that, if he knew it were to be cut ſhort before the end of the world. And this himſelf alſo aſſures the Church of in all its variety of ſtates, <hi>Revel</hi> 2.1. <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that holds the ſeven Stars in his right hand, who walks in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as he deſcribes himſelf by this title when he ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was the firſt ſtate of the Church, not only aſſuring her of his holding her Star; and walking by her Candleſtick, but all the reſt that were to follow, ſo he doth renew the ſame expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in part when he ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which is the riſing of the Church from the Apoſtacy wherein it had been covered in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> ſtate, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Stars.</hi> The ſeven ſpirits of God ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the gifts for the building and perfecting the Church ſtill in the hand of Chriſt, which ſhould be in a more plentiful way poured out than for ſome time before, as they were in the firſt reformation. He is ſtill therefore as a Prophet walking in the Church in all ages. Not only in the firſt Foundation of it by the Apoſtles, but in the reformation of it, after it had been buried in Superſtition and Idolatry. And at the reſtauration of the Church in the world, there ſhall be a pure river of water as <hi>clear as Chriſtal, proceeding from the Throne of God and the Lamb, Revel.</hi> 22.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> Pure doctrine without any mud and mixtures.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>'Tis his part as a Prieſt to eſtabliſh it in the favour of God, and look to the reparations of his Temple.</hi> The Church is his Temple. A Temple is the proper ſeat &amp; the proper care of a Prieſt. He is <hi>a Prieſt</hi> ſtill <hi>upon his Throne, Zach.</hi> 6.13. and that <hi>for ever.</hi> As he hath therefore ſome thing to offer, ſo he hath always ſome for whom he offers; who are they but his Church? His prayer on earth, <hi>John</hi> 17. was but a model or draught of his interceſſion in Heaven; one part of it is for preſervation of them <hi>through the truth of God, John</hi> 17.17. The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Goſpel in the world in order to a ſanctification of ſome is the matter of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which is one part of his Prieſtly Office. And we cannot imagine his plea for his Church to be weaker on his throne, it being alſo a throne of grace, than it was for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when he was upon a croſs of ſuffering. The <hi>compaſſions</hi> annext to his Prieſthood <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill, Heb.</hi> 4.15. If his office, be perpetual, the qualifications neceſſary to that office are as durable as the office it ſelf, as long as there is any object for their exerciſe. To what purpoſe are his compaſſions, if he ſhould not pity her for whom they were deſigned, and for whoſe behoof he was furniſht with them? He cannot be faithful to God in his office, if he be not merciful and tender to <hi>Sion</hi> in her diſtreſſes. He certainly pities her as he would himſelf, were it poſſible he ſhould be in an infirm condition. He muſt loſe his Soul before he can loſe his pity, and the Church muſt ceaſe to be his body, before ſhe can ceaſe to be the object of his compaſſions He hath the ſame ſentiments now that he had when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Paul from Heaven, Act.</hi> 9.4. It was not then, Why perſecuteſt thou <hi>mine,</hi> but why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou <hi>me?</hi> Nor is it ſo now; as the relation continues the ſame, ſo doth the compaſſion, ſo do his ſentiments, ſo do his cares. To what purpoſe doth he as a Prieſt ſit upon a Throne of grace, if he did not ſhew grace to his <hi>Sion</hi> againſt the cruel deſigns of her <hi>enemies?</hi> As God pities us when he remembers <hi>our frame, Pſal</hi> 103.13, 14. So no queſtion doth Chriſt, when he remembers <hi>Sions</hi> oppreſſions, as a diſtreſſed child is the object of the fathers pitty. Add to this, That ſince the death of Chriſt was one part of his Prieſtly performance, and that the virtue of his ſacrifice is as eternal as his Prieſt-hood, what a diſparagement would it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There can be no moment wherein it is not valid to expiate the ſins of ſome men, and therefore not a moment wherein the world ſhall be without a <hi>Sion,</hi> whoſe ſins are expiated by it. Should the ſtandar'd of <hi>Sion</hi> be ſnatcht away and torn by the powers of darkneſs, what would become of the glory, what would become of the virtue of the Redeemers death? Would God conſecrate him ſo ſolemnly by an oath to be a Prieſt, to ſo little purpoſe? How could it be for ever, if the execution of that office ſhould be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ceſſation of a Church as long as the world ſtands upon its pillars? Would it not be an empty title, if the end of it were not performed? We cannot imagine the falling of <hi>Sion,</hi> but we muſt queſtion the merit of his death, the truth of his exaltation, the ſtrength of his interceſſion, the faithfulneſs of his office, and the ſincerity and candor of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>'Tis his part as a King to eſtabliſh</hi> Sion <hi>in being, and govern her.</hi> The Prophets always
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41445:19"/> teſtified, that of his <hi>Government there ſhould be no end.</hi> If the Church ſhould ceaſe for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, what ſubjects would he have to govern here? Can he be a King without a Kingdom, or a governour without ſubjects, to bear a voluntary and ſincere witneſs to his name? If he be <hi>King in Sion,</hi> he will alſo have a <hi>Sion</hi> to own him, and a <hi>Sion</hi> to rule in; not only a conqueſt of the Serpentine brood and infernal powers was promiſed, but the total and perpetual victory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſted of the woman was to bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> When the <hi>head is bruiſed,</hi> there is no more wiſdom to guide, or force to Spirit the arm and the other members of the body It was a promiſe made not only of Chriſt to man, but of a compleat victory to Chriſt, that he ſhould outwit the Serpents wiſdom and utterly diſcomfit the Serpents power. If the conqueſt were not perfect and perpetual, it could not be called a <hi>ſpoiling of principalities and powers,</hi> as it is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. but an interruption or temporary check, whence they might reſcue themſelves. He is therefore ſaid <hi>to ſtill the enemy and the avenger</hi>

And it being his end to deſtroy the works of the Devil, the deſtroying the works muſt be the root of the being and preſervation of the Church. Did Chriſt then riſe as a Conquerour out of the grave, and ſit down as King upon his throne, to let the Devil and the world run away with the fruits of his victory? Will he be ſo injurious to himſelf, as to let his Throne be overturned by his enemies? And to let the adverſary of <hi>Sion</hi> repoſſeſs himſelf of that, which he hath been ſo powerfully and ſucceſsfully ſtript of? Chriſt being King cannot be chaſed out of his Kingdom, nor wants power to keep it from being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſted.

Chriſt as King will never leave beating up the quarters of Hell, till he hath utterly routed their force, and made the partizans of it his footſtool, and thereby eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sion</hi> beyond the fears of any tottering. Therefore when he ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which was to have a ſore conflict with the Devil and feel the ſmart of him for 10 <hi>days,</hi> underſtanding thoſe 10 <hi>Ancient perſecutions</hi> of the Church, he aſſumes a new title for her encouragement, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Theſe things ſaith the firſt and the laſt, which was dead and is alive.</hi> I was the firſt that liſted you and embodied you for the war, and I will be the laſt to bring up the rear; I was firſt in raiſing you, and I will be the laſt in preſerving you. Fear not the terror of thoſe perſecutions though they be to blood and death; I was uſed ſo, I was dead, but I am now alive, and I live for my Church, to behold her battles, to procure her victory, and to <hi>Crown</hi> thoſe that ſhall fall in the fight againſt her enemies. Chriſt in encouraging them to ſuffer for him, aſſures them of the ſecurity of a Church; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould not waſt the whole, but caſt ſome of them into priſon, not all, and that for their refining, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon that you may be tryed.</hi> Chriſt lives ſtill, and acts as King for the ſecurity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and preſerving a Generation to ſerve him, till the time comes that is promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. that <hi>there ſhall be no more curſe, but the Throne of God and of the Lamb</hi> ſhall be in it, and then his <hi>Servants ſhall ſerve him</hi> with a full ſecurity from all trouble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Foundation of Sion is ſure.</hi> 'Tis founded upon Chriſt the <hi>corner ſtone.</hi> Chriſt is called the <hi>Foundation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Church is ingrafted in Chriſt,</hi> united to him, one with him; the parts of it are reckoned as his <hi>ſeed</hi>

            <p>The Church is his <hi>own</hi> body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.29, 30. In loving and eſtabliſhing the Church, he loves &amp; eſtabliſheth himſelf. Whatſoever is implanted in nature as a perfection, is eminently in God. Now, ſince he hath twiſted with our natures, a care of our own bodies, this care muſt be much more in the nature of Chriſt, becauſe his Church is as nearly united to him, as our members to the fleſh and the bones; and he hath an higher affection to his myſtical, than we can have to our natural bodies. Chriſt will no leſs ſecure and perfect his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than a man would improve the beauty and ſtrength of his natural body, to preſerve it from wounds, from being mangled or ſcarrified, unleſs it be for the ſecurity of the whole. If he did not do it, it would be a hatred of his own fleſh, which never any man in his right wits was ever guilty of. The Eternity of Chriſt is made the Foundation of the Churches Eſtabliſhment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27, 28. <hi>Thou art the Son, and thy years ſhall have no end. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy ſervants ſhall continue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee.</hi> There could be no ſtrength in the Argument without union and communion with him: The Church is ſettled upon him as a Foundation, and therefore is of as long a duration as the Foundation upon which it ſtands; the conjunction is ſo ſtrait, that if one fails the other muſt; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince as Chriſt is <hi>the head,</hi> the Church is his <hi>fulneſs,</hi> Eph. 1.22, 23. <hi>Sion</hi> cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat but in him, and Chriſt cannot be compleat without her. A Foundation is of little uſe without a Superſtructure, a building falls not without a diſcredit to the Foundation upon which it ſtood. <hi>Sions</hi> compleatneſs depends upon the ſtrength of Chriſt, and Chriſts myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis founded upon the Covenant.</hi> Upon that which endures for ever, and ſhall ſurvive the Funeral of the whole world.

If the Church hath a duration and ſtability, then <hi>Ordinances and Miniſtry are perpetual.</hi> Miniſters may be thruſt into corners, clapt up in priſon, hurried to their graves; but the Sepulchres of Miniſters are not the graves of the Miniſtry. A Miniſtry, and a Church, Ordinances and a Church, cannot be ſeparated; they run parallel together to the end of the world; for <hi>Sion</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed without Divine Officers, and Divine Inſtitutions; the one cannot be eſtabliſhed without the other.

As there are ſeven States of the Church, ſo there are ſeven <hi>Stars</hi> in the hand of Chriſt for all thoſe States; the Miniſtry have the ſame ſupport, the ſame Guardian as the Church her ſelf. What was in the <hi>Epheſian</hi> and Primitive State, is alſo in the <hi>Sardian</hi> State, the State of the Church riſing from corruption of Doctrine and Ordinances<note n="*" place="margin">Rev <hi>3.1.</hi> Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven ſpirits of God, and the ſeven Stars.</note>.

'Tis true, the Church is in a wilderneſs condition, and hath been ſo <hi>for above</hi> 1200 <hi>years;</hi> but hath ſhe yet ſeen her Funeral? No, ſhe hath a place for her reſidence, and food for her nouriſhment, and both provided for her by that God that fram'd her, by that God that ſtood by her in the pangs of her travel, and ſhelter'd her <hi>Man-child</hi> from the fury of her enemies<note n="*" place="margin">

Though there be a ſmoke in the Temple, a cloud and obſcurity, the Truths and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God not ſo clear, ſo efficacious as they have been, as ſome underſtand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.8. or as they ſhall be; yet there is a Temple ſtill. A ſmoke in the Temple ſuppoſeth a Temple ſtanding, and Ordinances in it: The obſcurity of a thing nulls not the being of it, nor a cloud upon the Sun the ſtability and motion of it. He that denies a Church, a Miniſtry, and Divine Ordinances in it, muſt firſt charge Chriſt with falſhood, when he promiſed to be <hi>with them to the end of the world.</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20. <hi>Alway, even to the end of the world.</hi> Not to ſuſtain their particular perſons to the end of the world, but their Doctrine in a ſucceſſion of ſome, to teach and baptize by virtue of Authority from him; for to that doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and command refer, and not unto the continuance of the Apoſtolical dignity, or of their extraordinary gifts of miracles, but the duration of their ſtanding work till the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were laid, with the loud acclamations of grace, grace.

The promiſe of ſtability to <hi>Sion,</hi> is not to be underſtood of the firmneſs of her palaces but the duration of her inhabitants; as when God is ſaid to <hi>build a houſe,</hi> 'tis not to be underſtood of the rearing the walls, but increaſing the family.<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 2.21. <hi>God made them houſes, i. e.</hi> gave them chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> Every renew'd man, every one truly born in <hi>Sion</hi> ſtands upon the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Covenant, hath the ſame Charter with <hi>Sion</hi> her ſelf, and therefore upon a ſurer ground than any particular ſociety of men in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as mount</hi> Sion, <hi>which cannot be remov'd, but abides for ever.</hi> He is upon a better Foundation of ſecurity than the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> or <hi>Smyrna, Pergamus</hi> or <hi>Sardis,</hi> which have loſt their footing, and their places know them no more.

Chaff may as well ſtop the wind, and force it to another quarter; Stubble may as well quench the fury of the flames, as the Enemies of <hi>Sion</hi> be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the God of <hi>Sion.</hi> As he hath a <hi>Fire</hi> in <hi>Sion</hi> to warm her; ſo he hath a <hi>Furnace</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to conſume her Enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.9. a Fire to burn his Peoples droſs, but a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to diſſolve his Enemies force. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is an Example to all Generations, to warn men not to ſtruggle with thoſe whom God reſolves to patronize; how did he further his own deſtruction by his hardneſs, and the deliverance of the oppreſſed by his fury? How often is the violence of her Enemies the occaſion of the manifeſtation of God's glory, and the ſetling <hi>Sion</hi>'s ſecurity? Had not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> been ſo furious, God had not manifeſted the glory of his Power, nor his <hi>Iſrael</hi> enjoyed ſo miraculous a ſafety. 'Tis true, the Church is weak, but the Arm that holds her, is the ſtrongeſt in Heaven and Earth. Her outward Intereſt is ſmall, but her Intereſt is twiſted with that of her Lord. An Enemy ſhall find more miſchief from mud-walls, under the protection of a valiant Arm, than from ſtone-walls, under the guard of an Infant. How fooliſh is it for a man to think to break a Rock with his fiſt for hurting his ſhins, whereby he bruiſeth his hands, as well as his leggs? How fooliſh is it for men to beat the buſhes about a Lions Den, whereby they will be ſure to rouſe him? God dwells in <hi>Sion,</hi> from thence he <hi>roars,</hi> to the <hi>ſhaking of Heaven and Earth,</hi> the Powers of the world, when he will manifeſt himſelf to be <hi>the hope of his People, and the ſtrength of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What a ground is here for prayer!</hi> This ſets an edg upon prayer. No petition can more comfortably, no petition can more confidently be put up, than for <hi>Sions</hi> eſtabliſhment. Prayers for particular Perſons, or for our ſelves may want ſucceſs, but ſupplications for <hi>Sion</hi> never miſcarry, they have the ſame Foundation for an anſwer, that <hi>Sion</hi> hath for her ſtability, <hi>viz.</hi> The promiſe of God; they are agreeable to that affection which ſhall never be removed from her: How believingly may we cry out, <hi>Be it unto</hi> Sion <hi>according to thy word?</hi> There is no fear of a repulſe; whatſoever God denies, he will not deny that for which he hath ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf. It may be for the good of the Church, that ſo great a perſon as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould lye in Chains, and his Fetters conduce to the <hi>furtherance of the Goſpel, Phil.</hi> 1.12. But it can never be for the Intereſt of <hi>Sion,</hi> or for the Intereſt of <hi>Sion</hi>'s God, that ſhe ſhould be cruſht between the teeth of the Lions, and that which he hath redeemed by the blood of his Son, be a prey to the Jaws of the Devil. God hath entitled <hi>Sion</hi> by the name of a <hi>City not forſaken, Iſa.</hi> 62.12. And as we have his promiſe for her ſettlement, ſo we have his command for our earneſtneſs; <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>And give him no reſt, till he doth eſtabliſh</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the whole Earth.</hi> And he preſcribes us to back that by our prayers, which he had promis'd, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>For</hi> Jeruſalem's <hi>ſake I will not reſt till the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs.</hi> Our deſires in this caſe are ſuited to his reſolves, and run in the ſame line with his immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Decree; he will have no reſt in himſelf, nor he would have no reſt from us, till this be accompliſht. We cannot call upon God with a greater confidence for any thing, than for that Church that ſhall out-live the Funeral of the world, and ſurvive the frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſhall lie in Aſhes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What a ſtrong ground is here for truſt!</hi> Look not ſo much upon the condition of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Walls, as upon her Foundation; not upon her preſent poſture, as upon her promiſe-Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not upon her as a weak Vine, but under the hand of the Higheſt, as the Vine-dreſſer; look not upon the feebleneſs of the Flock, but upon the care of the Shepherd; nor upon the fierceneſs of the Lions, but upon the ſtrength and affection of her Guardian.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Let not our Faith reſt upon appearances.</hi> Fleſh will then make a wrong Judgment of God. Providences are various, and ſhould our Faith be guided only by them, it would have a livelineſs one moment, and faint the next. As the Promiſe is the ſtability of the Church, ſo it is only the ſtability of our Faith. The Authority of the Word is the Life of our Faith, and not the ſenſe of any particular Providence in the world. A Faith built upon protecting Providences is a ſenſitive Faith, a Faith built upon the Promiſe, is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Yet the Experiences God hath given us hitherto of the continuance of the Church, may be called in to bear witneſs to the Truth of the Promiſe.</hi> He hath before conducted his <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> meditated their utter ruine, or their continuance under his Chains; he fed them with Manna, and watered them with a Rock in a deſert, that afforded no earthly aſſiſtance. The preſerving the Vine could never be aſcribed to the Vine it ſelf, in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41445:21"/> which there is no ſtrength; nor to the Foxes, in whom there is no pitty; but to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the vineyard. We have reaſon therefore to truſt God, but not at all to truſt man; Is it from man or from God that the Church hath ſubſiſted ſo long in the world, a little flock in the midſt of many Wolves, among enemies more numerous than her friends? What a ſmall number hath the Church had in any age to mate the multitude of her enemies, what wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to countermine their policy, and what power to repel their force? The Church is not weaker now, than it hath been; the Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> were always Sheep; Sheep have not the ſtrength of Lyons to reſiſt, nor the ſwiftneſs of Eagles to fly away from danger; the danger cannot be greater than it hath been, there were always <hi>Dragons</hi> that ſpat out their venom, and <hi>Lyons</hi> that opened their mouths againſt her; the Devil never wanted diligence nor the <hi>world</hi> enmity to overturn her; could ſhe for one moment have ſubſiſted in the midſt of ſo many furies, had not God been her ſhield, and glory? Call to mind how often God hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her diſeaſes, and bound up her wounds. Let us reſt in that promiſe, which hath ſo often been made good by his power, which he hath in many ages diſplayed upon as great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of danger as <hi>Sion</hi> can be in. Let us live believingly under his wings, and fear not our own weakneſs or our enemies ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We have greater ground of confidence than the Church of Iſrael had.</hi> In the day of <hi>Iſraels</hi> trouble by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> the Prophet comforts the Church in her anguiſh, by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who was to aſſume the <hi>Government,</hi> though many years after, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1, 6. Shall a promiſe, that was to ſtay ſo many ages for performance, be a ground of truſt and confidence to a tottering Church then? And ſhall not the ſtaggering Church have more ground to reſt, ſince the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is made the head of the Corner, and hath the Keys of Hell and death delivered to him? What a baſe thing is diſtruſt then againſt ſo many aſſurances of ſtability, and the experience of a multitude of ages? Graſp the promiſe, plead it earneſtly, ſhew God his written word which he hath ſent from Heaven, he never yet diſowned it, nor ever will. Methinks, the voice, <hi>God is able to deliver Sion,</hi> ſounds too much of diſtruſt. If we know no more than Gods power, we know not ſo much as the Devil doth; he knows his power, and he knows his promiſe. Let us therefore firſt eye the promiſe, which God loves, and the Devil fears, and then call in his power to back his word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Regard not man.</hi> Too much eye upon him implies too little upon God, as if Gods Word were not enough to create and ſupport a confidence without the buttreſſes of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtrength. All dependance on man is either upon a <hi>broken reed,</hi> that cannot ſupport it ſelf, or a <hi>piercing reed,</hi> that wounds inſtead of healing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.6. 'Tis a diſhonour to God, and provokes him to lengthen a miſery and retard a deliverance. The nearer <hi>Sion</hi> comes to a final ſettlement, the more God will act by himſelf, either without inſtruments, or in a more ſignally ſpiriting Inſtruments, that himſelf ſhall be more viſible in them than themſelves. <hi>The Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi> If he be the Higheſt he is fit to be truſted by us, if he will do it himſelf, it is fit we ſhould couple none with him. The nearer the time comes wherein God will appear <hi>himſelf,</hi> the more we ſhould depend upon him himſelf; the exerciſe of faith ſhould be ſtrongeſt, when the promiſe, the object of faith, is neareſt its Meridian. Let us be more careful to keep our faith from ſinking, and let God alone to keep his Church from ſinking.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>of Comfort.</hi> The Churches Patent is ſingular, the greateſt worldly Society could never ſhew the fellow of it. <hi>The Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi> There is not ſuch a clauſe in the ſettlement of any nation. Why ſhould we be afraid then of the joynt conſpiracy of men or Devils? He that hath laid the Foundation, can, and will preſerve the Superſtructure, not only becauſe he formed it, but becauſe he hath promiſed it. When Chriſt would reveal to <hi>John</hi> the future condition, and conflicts of the Church to the end of the world, he appears like a conquerour with all the enſigns of authority and power about him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15, 16. He hath <hi>eyes like a flame</hi> to pierce his enemies, <hi>Feet like braſs</hi> to cruſh them, <hi>a two edged Sword out of his mouth,</hi> to pierce them; and this, while he is in the midſt of the ſeven Candleſticks; The ſeveral alterations and periods of the Church to the end of the world, to preſerve and cleanſe them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is <hi>comfort in the confuſions and troubles of the world.</hi> The ſhaking of Heaven and Earth were the harbingers of the appearance of Chriſt for Redemption, and laying the <hi>corner ſtone of</hi> Sion, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. The ſame methods will be uſed when he ſhall come to lay the top-ſtone, and compleat all the fruits of <hi>Redemption, Luke</hi> 21.25, 26.28. The confuſion of the world is the reſtauration of <hi>Sion;</hi> a ſtorm or ruſhing mighty wind preceded the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effuſion of the Spirit upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the blowing the Goſpel into every <hi>corner, Act.</hi> 2.2. Never were the diſciples in ſo hopeleſs a condition as before the Reſurrection of Chriſt, the ground of the Churches ſtability; they then expected to ſee his face no more. What commotions and thunders are deſcribed in the <hi>Revelation</hi> before the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> comes down from Heaven, &amp; God pitch his Tabernacle among men? But he ſuffers not thoſe commotions to be raiſed in the world by the miniſtring Angel, till the ſervants of God be ſealed in the <hi>forehead,</hi> for their preſervation in thoſe confuſions which ſhall be the ruin of their <hi>enemies, Revel.</hi> 7.2, 3. The ark may ſhake with the motion of the oxen, but it cannot fall. <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark may be toſt by the waves that drown the world, but not ſink, and at laſt <hi>reſt upon the mountains of Ararat.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Here is comfort <hi>in Perſecutions.</hi> Perſecution is yet for a while the Lot of the Church; a Sea and a Wilderneſs are yet the paſſage to <hi>Canaan.</hi> The firſt Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> of a numerous Seed, was with the comparing it to the <hi>duſt of the Earth, Gen.</hi> 3.16. Duſt that is trampled upon, Duſt that is removed by a puff of wind. But the next was by comparing it to the <hi>Stars in Heaven, Gen.</hi> 15.5. that are bright, and fixed, and have their orderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Before the Introduction of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> State of the Church, or Brotherly State, (which it is likely we are not far from) the Promiſe of Glory to them that overcome, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a Combate, and the Promiſe of Chriſt's confeſſing the names of ſuch before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, implies a time before the Period of the <hi>Sardian</hi> State, wherein the Church is to bear a ſignal Teſtimony to the Truths of Chriſt in the way of a <hi>Conflict, Rev.</hi> 3.5. The glorious State of the Church at the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, ſhall be preceded by ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity as ſhall be the terrour of the godly, and the triumph of an <hi>Enemy</hi> devoted to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected deſtruction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Perſecutions make way for <hi>Sion</hi>'s ſtability. Never was ſhe firmer and purer than in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and thoſe immediately following them, when the Witneſſes for the Truth, to the loſs of their blood, were as numerous as the Survivors: ſhe was then, when the flood was caſt out againſt her, clothed with the <hi>Sun, and crowned with a Crown of twelve Stars, Rev.</hi> 12.1, 2. Such troubles now may dim the outward ſplendour, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her inward Spirit, and refine her to that temper ſhe was in in the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity. Proſperity was never much the Churches Friend: Poyſon was flung in her diſh when ſhe gain'd an earthly felicity, and the fondneſs of great ones. Her ſtability con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in this, but in the graces and ſpirit of Chriſtianity: That which eſtabliſht her Head, eſtabliſheth the Body; her Captain aſcended not from Mount <hi>Oliver,</hi> till he had ſuffered on Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> The Church was never deſcribed ſo glorious in her outward Attire, as her greateſt Enemy, that is clothed in <hi>Scarlet,</hi> and deckt with <hi>Gold, Rev.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Sion</hi>'s glory is internal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious within.</hi> All thoſe Perſecutions that are yet to come upon her, ſhall not demoliſh her Walls: The rigours of her Enemies, and the Treaſons of her pretended Friends, have not yet expelled her out of the Earth; ſhe hath not yet ſunk, though her Maſts have been ſometimes cut cloſe to the Deck, and her viſible Pilots flung over-board into the Sea; and ſhall ſhe ſink when ſhe is not far from an entrance into the Harbour? She hath been <hi>a Brand pluckt out of the fire, Zach.</hi> 3.2. She was pluckt out of the Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſhall be pluckt out of the Furnace of <hi>Myſtical Babylon.</hi> Though ſhe ſhould be mown down as Graſs by the Sythe of her Enemies, yet the preſence of Chriſt ſhall be as <hi>Rain</hi> upon her, to make her ſprout and ſpread after all her Afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6. Though ſhe hath been in the midſt of the Fire, ſhe never yet was, nor ever will be conſumed: She hath had joy in her diſgraces, and greatneſs by her flames: She hath alwaies had a God to inſpire her with vigor, to ſuſtain her weakneſs, and prop her by his Arm, and hath often ſwam to a ſafe Harbour in a Tyde of her own Blood. Is not that God ſtill a ſufficient Defence, and the Promiſe a ſufficient Charter againſt the Violence of the world: <hi>The Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her;</hi> Himſelf by his own Arm, and Himſelf by his own Methods.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Here is <hi>Comfort in the deepeſt deſigns of her Enemies. The Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi>

            <p>If he be the Higheſt, and imploys himſelf as the Higheſt, there is none ſo high as to over-top him, none ſo high as to out-wit him. Though their Union be never ſo cloſe, and their Projects never ſo deep, yet God's being with the Church, is curb enough for them, and comfort enough for <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves together, O ye people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Take counſel together, and it ſhall come to naught; ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand; for God is with us.</hi> God's preſence with <hi>Sion</hi> blows away all. God was with the Ark in its cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and made it victorious in its Chains. It cripled <hi>Dagon</hi> the <hi>Philiſtins Idol,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. and made them return it to their diſgrace, which they thought they had ſeiz'd upon to their honour. While God is a ſtrength to the poor, the <hi>branch of the terrible ſhall be brought low,</hi> and their <hi>blaſt</hi> be but as <hi>a ſtorm againſt a wall, Iſa.</hi> 25.4, 5. He can haſten their ruine by their own ſubtilty, and catch them in their <hi>own Net, Pſal.</hi> 35.8. Or, he can turn them to <hi>glorifie</hi> the Church, as much as they hindred her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.3. They are ſometimes compared to <hi>Bees, Pſal.</hi> 118.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.18. and the can make them afford honey as well as a ſting. They are Bees for their wrath, and Bees for their weakneſs, and many times Bees for her profit. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he makes the Houſe of <hi>Jacob as fire,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Houſe of</hi> Eſau <hi>as ſtubble before him, Obad.</hi> 18. 'Tis not more natural to the Serpents Seed to ſpite the Church, than it is natural to God to protect her; their malice cannot engage them ſo much in Attempts againſt her, as God's
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41445:22"/> Promiſe engageth him in the defence of her. What can weakneſs do againſt ſtrength? folly againſt wiſdom? Hell againſt Heaven? and a fallen <hi>Lucifer</hi> againſt the higheſt God?</p>

               <hi>The Mountain of the Lords Houſe ſhall be lifted up on the top of the Mountains, Iſa.</hi> 2.2. In the laſt days it ſhall be more glorious than any Mountain dignified by God: Above Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where the Law was given, the terreſtial Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Temple was built, Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> had a type of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> by prayer diſcomfited <hi>Amalek,</hi> and Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> had a proſpect of <hi>Canaan.

Then ſhall he, as he did at the Feaſt in <hi>Cana,</hi> turn the Churches Water into Wine. <hi>Idols ſhall be utterly aboliſht, Iſa.</hi> 2.18. Droſs and mixtures in Doctrine and Worſhip <hi>purged out,</hi> Rev. 22.1. <hi>The River of the water of life ſhall be as clear as Cryſtal, proceeding from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb. The everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached, Rev.</hi> 14.6. called everlaſting, becauſe it ſhall never more be clouded and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the fooliſh Inventions of men; there ſhall be no more <hi>Sea, Rev.</hi> 21.1. The troubles of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſignified by a ſtormy Sea, ſhall ceaſe, and <hi>a new Heaven,</hi> and <hi>a new Earth</hi> be created; there ſhall be multitude of converſions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>The Kingdoms of the world ſhall become the Kingdoms of Chriſt.</hi> The breath of the Lord ſhall come into many, and make them <hi>ſtand upon their feet, Ezek.</hi> 37.9, 10. There ſhall be a greater preſence of God in Ordinances, for the Earth <hi>ſhall ſhine with his glory, Ezek.</hi> 43.2. <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſhall ſparkle in her, for the <hi>glory of the Lord ſhall be upon her, Rev.</hi> 21.11. His holineſs to purifie her, and his power to protect her. Perſecutions without, and diviſions within, ſhall ceaſe; <hi>Satan ſhall be bound,</hi> his force reſtrained; he ſhall not wander about with his cloven-foot, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. The <hi>Sea of Glaſs,</hi> which was mingled with fire, with the fire of worldly Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the fire of inteſtine Animoſities, ſhall be as <hi>clear as Cryſtal, Rev.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. He will then have Magiſtrates no longer carrying on the Intereſt of the God of this world, but the Intereſt of the Church, whom he calls his Princes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.8. His, becauſe ſet up by a more immediate Providence: His, becauſe acting deſignedly and intentionally for his glory; no more pinching his People, and making a prey of his <hi>Sion,</hi> but laying down <hi>their Crowns at the foot of his Throne.</hi> And to compleat all, there ſhall be a perpetuity in this ſpiritual proſperity; only between the beginning and compleating it Satan ſhall <hi>be let looſe:</hi> But for a little ſeaſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. and after this it ſhall not have one blow more from Hell; but the Devil muſt for ever give over nibbling at her heel. Now the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet found ſuch a ſtate ſuitable to thoſe promiſes and predictions; ſome great thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be accompliſht, which the world hath not yet ſeen, nor the Church experienced. But that Truth that will not lye, that Truth which cannot lye, has aſſured it. The <hi>Myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, Rev.</hi> 10.7. The Church hath hitherto been gaſping in the fire, and in the water; ſhe has liv'd, but as wrapt in a winding-ſheet; the Saints under the Altar have cryed a long time for the vengeance of the Temple to recompence their blood. There is a time when this <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that hath lain begging at the door of the rich and mighty, ſhall be mounted up to a better ſtate. <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall enjoy a Reſurrection, and fling off all badges of a Funeral. For <hi>the Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If God ſhall <hi>eſtabliſh her,</hi> ſtability is not to be found out of her. To depart from her, is to leave a firm Rock to find ſecurity in a quick-ſand. To leap out of a ſtout Ship in a ſtorm, to expect a preſervation in the waves. To turn our backs upon Heaven, to ſeek eaſe in the bowels of Hell. The Altar at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> is caſt down, and <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Altar is demoliſht when that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtood.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us love Sion.</hi> There is nothing the <hi>Scripture</hi> uſes more as an argument to ſeparate our affections from the world than the uncertainty and fading nature of it.

Our affections to Goſpel-<hi>Sion</hi> ſhould be more tender, ſince God hath poured out more of his Spirit upon her, and ſhe is more amiable in his eye.

There is a pleaſure to be taken in her ſtones, becauſe they ſhall be again
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41445:22"/> ſet in their place, a favour to be ſhewn to her duſt, becauſe it ſhall be again compacted, and enjoy a reſurrection, For the higheſt that hath promiſed to eſtabliſh her, will not deſert her in her ruins, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up</hi> Sion <hi>he ſhall appear in glory;</hi> we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more ground to favour her duſt than to admire the proudeſt palaces.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Let us deſire the Eſtabliſhment of Sion more than our own private Eſtabliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the Sign of a gracious Spirit to look <hi>not only on his own things but the things of others, Phil.</hi> 2.4. And what things of others ſhould be regarded, if the things of Chriſt and his Spouſe be over-looked. No private perſon hath any promiſe of eſtabliſhment but as he is a Deniſon of <hi>Sion,</hi> as one born in her. In deſiring therefore the welfare of <hi>Sion,</hi> we wiſh and make way for the eſtabliſhing of our ſelves; our intereſts are common with hers. Her proſperity therefore ſhould be the firſt and laſt of our wiſhes. When we wiſh the ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sion,</hi> we wiſh the honour of God, the continuance of his worſhip, the glorifying his name which is depoſited in that cabinet; The glory of God cannot flouriſh, if the Church periſh. How baſe then are thoſe, that if they can ſwim in a worldly proſperity, care not if the Church be drowned in tears and bloud; that cloth themſelves and regard not her nakedneſs; that provide an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> for themſelves, and care not what deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late deſert <hi>Sion</hi> ſits weeping in?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Let us endeavour the eſtabliſhment of Sion.</hi> 'Tis a grateful thing to a Prince to favour his favorite. Let us be as forward to enlarge her Territories, as the Devil and his inſtruments are to increaſe the Suburbs of hell. The Higheſt himſelf will eſtabliſh her by himſelf; we muſt therefore take thoſe methods which are agreeable to the chief preſerver. A comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Enemies of God was never the way to ſecure the intereſt of <hi>Sion.</hi> A divine work in a divine way will meet with divine aſſiſtance. To contribute to the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Sion</hi> is a work honourable in it ſelf, ſince it is the work of God himſelf; 'Tis an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the higheſt pattern. In this we are aſſociates, and coworkers, with God. For <hi>the Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh</hi> Sion.</p>

            <p>AN Anniverſary Commemoration of a memorable Deliverance falling upon this Day, hath cauſed a diverſion of my thoughts, to look back, not only upon a mercy never to be forgotten, but to look forward to that Deliverance which is to come parallel to this in the Text. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a Type of the Church, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> a type of the Churches Enemies in all Ages of the world, both of the ſpiritual Enemy, Satan, and of the temporal, his Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>The Deliverance was a type of the Deliverance that Chriſt wrought upon the Croſs by his Blood. Alſo, of that Chriſt works by his power upon his Throne, the one from the Reign of Sin, the other from the Empire of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>This was the Exemplar of all the deliverances the Church was to have. As the Aſſyrian ſhould lift up a ſtaff againſt Jeruſalem, <hi>after the manner of Aegypt,</hi> ſo the Lord ſhould lift his rod up for them <hi>upon the Sea after the manner of Aegypt,</hi> when the <hi>Yoke ſhall be deſtroyed becauſe of the anointing, Iſa.</hi> 10.26, 27. when the power of the Enemies ſhall be deſtroyed by the ſtrength of Chriſt. The Lord himſelf makes it his pattern in thoſe victories he is to gain for his people; when he calls upon his <hi>arm</hi> to <hi>awake as in the ancient days,</hi> when he <hi>cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wounded the Dragon, and made the depths of the Sea a way for the ranſom'd to paſs over, Iſa.</hi> 51.9, 10, 11. then <hi>the redeemed of the Lord ſhall come with ſinging unto Sion,</hi> the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> while they ſtand upon a <hi>Sea of Glaſs,</hi> a brittle, frail, and ſtormy world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. And our Redeemer makes this his pattern &amp; rule, when he comes to tread the Wine-preſs in wrath, and make them drunk with his fury, that then he would <hi>remember the days of old,</hi> Moſes <hi>and his people, when he divided the water before them, to make himſelf an everlaſting name, Iſa.</hi> 63.1.2.11. that his power may be as glorious in the latter, as it was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and all deliverances of the Church from the beginning to the end be knit together to be an everlaſting matter of praiſe to his name.</p>
            <p>This Hiſtorical narration is to have a more univerſal accompliſhment; the deliverance from Aegypt is promiſed to be fulfilled a ſecond time, and God would act the ſame part over again, as alſo their deliverance from <hi>Ogg</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 6.22. <hi>The Lord ſaid, I will bring again from</hi> Baſhan, <hi>I will bring my people from the depths of the Sea.</hi> This is after he had <hi>aſcended,</hi> v. 18. when he came to <hi>wound the head of his Enemies, v.</hi> 21. So Iſa. 11.15. <hi>The Lord ſhall utterly deſtroy the tongue of the Egyptian ſea, and with his mighty wind ſhall he ſhake his hand over the river, and ſhall ſmite it, in the ſeven ſtreams, and make men go over dry ſhod. Nilus</hi> with its ſeven ſtreams was the glory of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> with its ſeven hills is the glory of the Papacy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9. So Zac. 10.10. <hi>I will bring them again out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and they ſhall paſs through the ſea with Affliction,</hi> and the deeps <hi>of the river ſhall dry up. Pharaoh</hi> and his army cannot revive and ſtand up in their former ranks; but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41445:23"/> there ſhall be deliverances with reſemblances to that, when the Enemies ſhall be as arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and furious as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Church as dejected and ſtraitned as <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <hi>I will purſue.</hi> Had he no reflections upon his former ſucceſſeſs attempts to keep the Iſraelites in ſlavery? or could he with any reaſon hope to reduce them with his bafled ſtrength to that yoke, which had been broken by a powerful Arm? Had he not reaſon freſhly to remember his own inability to remove one of the plagues ſent upon them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Iſraels</hi> reſcue? Was that high arm which brought them out of Aegypt broken? Gods weapons blunted, his magazine of plaguing Ammunition waſted, &amp; his ſtrength too feeble to preſerve thoſe he had by a ſtrong hand redeemed? Theſe things be obvious to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s thoughts. Yet, <hi>I will</hi> ſtill <hi>purſue.</hi> How heady and raſh are the Churches Enemies! Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the uſher to Deſtruction: When you find the Churches Enemies loſe their wits, you may quickly expect they will loſe their ſtrength and lives.</p>
            <p>

            <p>How great is the pride of the Churches enemies! They ſtrut without thinking of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power to curb them, and promiſe themſelves the accompliſhment of their deſigns without fearing the check of Providence. Thus did <hi>Siſera's</hi> Mother triumph in a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hope before a victory, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5.30. and ſing <hi>Te Deum</hi> before a conqueſt. <hi>Ventoſa et inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens natio</hi> is the title <hi>Pliny</hi> gives the Aegyptian Nation.</p>

How ſecure are the Churches Enemies! The ſight of a glittering ſword, and an edict for a return they thought would quell their Spirits; 'Tis true they had to deal with an unarmed people, unprovided for defence, whoſe late ſlavery had rendered them unfit for military exerciſes, an unequal match for a numerous and diſciplin'd Army.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>How deſperate are ſomtimes the ſtraits of Gods Iſrael in the eye of man?</hi> How low their Spirits before deliverance? They here behold a deep Sea before them, and a raging Enemy behind them: Hear a confuſed noiſe of women and Children in the midſt of them, feel the pantings of their own hearts, &amp; perhaps ſee a conſternation in the faces of their governours; they ſee themſelves diſarmed of weapons, lying almoſt at the mercy of an oppreſſor, with a well furniſht Army; they repent of what God had done for them, and are more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſlavery than liberty; Quarrel with <hi>Moſes</hi> (And as one of their Hiſtorians ſaith, were about to ſtone him) <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10, 11, 12. Without doubt they then thought him a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and it is likely had no more honourable thoughts at that time of God; for when they ſaw the happy ſucceſs in the miraculous overthrow of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> then <hi>they believed God and his ſervant</hi> Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. as if they gave credit to neither of them before. They had a pillar of Fire, and a Cloud, the chariot of God; A greater argument to eſtabliſh them than the preparation of their enemies to terrifie them. But what a faithleſs creature is man under the viſible guard of Heaven, and ſo far naturally from living by faith, that he will hardly draw eſtabliſhments from ſenſe!</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God orders the luſts of men for his own praiſe.</hi> He had forced <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let the People go, he had ſtopt the ſtreams of his fury; when he removes his hand and pulls up the dam, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> returns to his former temper with more violence, thereby giving occaſion for God's glory in his own deſtruction; he ſerves himſelf of the deſperate malice of his enemies to make his Wiſdom and other Attributes more triumphant.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The nearer the deliverance of the Church is, the fiercer are Gods Judgments on the enemies of it, and the higher the enemies rage.</hi> The former plagues were but ſmall gaſhes in the Aegyptian ſtate: But when the time approach'd of the Iſraelites perfect Deliverance, then the firſt-born in every houſe, the delight and ſtrength of the parents is cut off: And at the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, the glory, flower and ſtrength of <hi>Aegypt</hi> buryed in the Sea; the fuller beams of mercy on the one are attended with more ſcorcing darts of judgments on the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>All creatures are abſolutely under the Soveraignty of God, and are acted by his Power in all their ſervices. Thy wind:</hi> All are ſubject to his conduct, and are the Guardians of his People, and the Conquerours of his Enemies. How eaſie is it for the Arm of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to demoliſh the ſtrongeſt preparations againſt his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and with a blaſt reduce their Power to nothing? The Sea ſuffers violence to preſerve his People, and the liquid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems transform'd into a wall of Braſs. God can make the meaneſt creatures Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Judgments, raiſe Troops of Flies to rout the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, as it was in <hi>Trajans</hi> Siege of the <hi>Agarens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>By the ſame means God ſaves his People, whereby he deſtroys his Enemies;</hi> the one ſank, the other paſt thorow; That which makes one balance ſink, makes the other riſe the higher; the red ſea was the Guardian of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Executioner of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Iſraelites gallery to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> grave. The cloud that led the Iſraelites through the red Sea, blinded the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> the waters that were 15 Cubits high above the mountains, kept the Ark from daſhing againſt them, whereby <hi>Noah</hi> might be indangered, and drowned the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies though never ſo high according to humane ſtature.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>The ſtrength and glory of a people is more waſted by oppoſing the Intereſt of the Church, than in conflicts with any other enemy.</hi> Had the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> arms been turned againſt any other Enemy, they might have proſpered, or at leaſt retired with a more partial defeat, or ſaved their lives though under chains. But when they would prepare them againſt Gods Iſrael, they meet with a total defeat where they expected victory, and find their graves where <hi>Iſrael</hi> found their Bulwarks; the choiceſt of their Youth, the flower of their Nobility, the ſtrongeſt of their chariots and horſes at one blow overthrown by God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>We may take notice of the folly of the Churches Enemies.</hi> Former plagues might have warned them of the power of God; they had but burned their own fingers by pinching her; yet they would ſet their force againſt Almighty power that ſo often had worſted them; 'tis as if men would pull down a ſteeple with a ſtring.</p>
            <p>But the Obſervations I ſhall treat of are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When the Enemies of the Church are in the higheſt fury and reſolution, and the Church in the greateſt extremity and dejection, then is the fitteſt time for God to work her deliverance fully and perfectly.</hi> When the Enemy ſaid, <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the Spoil,</hi> &amp;c. then God <hi>blowed with his wind,</hi> then <hi>they ſank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God is the Author of all the deliverances of the Church, whoſoever are the Inſtruments. [Thou didſt blow with thy wind; who is like unto the Lord among the Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, <hi>When the Enemies of the Church are in the higheſt fury,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Great reſolutions
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41445:24"/> againſt God meet with great Diſappointments. The Churches ſtraits are the enemies hopes, but Gods opportunity.</hi> When their fury is higheſt, Gods love is neareſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are four ſeaſons on the part of the Enemy God takes hold of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Flouriſhing Proſperity.</hi> Here is <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the head of a gallant Army, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in a Pound at his mercy. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> proſperity is a forerunner of their deſtruction, the adverſity of the other, of their ſalvation. <hi>Haman</hi> is in the top of his favour, when the <hi>Jews</hi> are marked out for ſlaughter, and then himſelf is marked out for ruine. Proſperity, like Rain, makes the weeds of Pride and Atheiſm to grow up, and then they are fit matter for God's Sickle to cut down. When the <hi>Cluſters of the Vine of the Earth are ripe,</hi> full of an outward glory and ſweetneſs, then <hi>the Angel thruſts in his ſharp Sickle, Rev.</hi> 14.18. There is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſet them. When <hi>the great City is clothed in fine Linnen, Purple and Scarlet, deckt with gold and pretious ſtones, Rev.</hi> 18.16. and come to the higheſt point of its glory and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then ſhall God thicken the clouds of his vengeance, and bring their riches to naught in one hour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Swelling Pride: I will purſue,</hi> &amp;c. Pride is provoking, becauſe it is a ſelf-deifying, and ſets up the creature as God's Mate. God ſtands upon his honour, and loves to attaque thoſe that would equal themſelves with him. Pride ſunk the glory of the fallen Angels into miſery, and ſo it will that of the Serpents ſeed; this is the immediate forerunner of deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. Men have their <hi>hairy ſcalp,</hi> the prime of their ſtrength, and pride of their hearts, when God <hi>wounds</hi> them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. <hi>Aegypt</hi> was become <hi>Rahab,</hi> pride it ſelf, as the word ſignifies, and ſo God called it by that name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9. When <hi>Aegypt</hi> mounted to <hi>Rahab,</hi> to the top of pride, then God cut it. When the Dragon briſtled, and erected his ſtately head to ſeiſe upon the prey, then God wounded him, put an end to <hi>Aegypts</hi> pride, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fear: He loves to beat down the pride of the one, and raiſe up the lowlineſs of the other. When <hi>Herod</hi> will aſſume the title of a God given him by the acclamations of the People, an Angel ſhall immediately make him a Banquet for Worms, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.22, 23. When <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had proſpered in his Conqueſt of <hi>Judea,</hi> had taken many ſtrong Towns, cloſely be leaguered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thundred out blaſphemies againſt God, and threatnings againſt his People, then comes an Angel, makes an horrible ſlaughter in a night, ſends him back to his own Country, where after the loſs of his Army he loſt his life by the hands of his own children.

Cum duplicantur lateres, venit</hi> Moſes. 'Tis Gods uſual method to let the Church be in great diſtreſs before he commands deliverance. <hi>The diſtreſs of the Church was great in the concern of this day, though it was not ſenſible, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance being known near as ſoon as the danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is to be in the depths of the Sea before ſhe be fully delivered, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 68.22. The Jews were to <hi>paſs through the Sea with affliction</hi> before the <hi>pride of Aſſyria</hi> ſhould be <hi>brought down, and the Scepter of Aegypt depart away;</hi> after that, he would ſtrengthen <hi>them in the Lord,</hi> and they ſhould <hi>walk up and down in his name, Zach.</hi> 10.11, 12. The ſharpeſt pangs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede deliverance; it was ſo when Chriſt came in the fleſh; it will be ſo at every new riſing of Chriſt in his ſpirit; when things were at a low ebb, when the Sun ſat in the greateſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Errour, Idolatry and prophaneſs, when the Jews, the only ſpot of ground God had, was as a wilderneſs almoſt barren of any grace, when the great predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were unminded, and leſs underſtood, when <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> had ceaſed, and the Spirit of Propheſy was ſhut up, then Chriſt comes in the fulneſs of time to work an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal relief for mankind. When the day of vengeance is in the heart of the Redeemer, he ſhall look and find none to help, he ſhall wonder to find none to uphold, therefore his own arm ſhall bring Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5.</p>
            <p>This has alwaies been God's Method. With his Son, the powers of darkneſs had their hour, and triumph'd when they had laid him in the grave before he was raiſed by the glory of his Father. The Witneſſes muſt be killed by the hand of their Enemies, before they ſtand upon their feet, and aſcend up into Heaven, in the ſight of their Adverſaries, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. when the Church ſhall walk in darkneſs, <hi>grope for the wall like the blind, mourn like Doves, look for ſalvation, and it ſhall ſeem far off;</hi> then will the Lord <hi>put on a helmet of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his head, and the garments of vengeance for clothing, and be clad with zeal as a cloak, Iſa.</hi> 59.9, 10, 11, 17. The break of day is uſhered in by a thicker darkneſs than that which clouded the night before. The ſharpeſt perſecution that ever the Church had, was in the time of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a little before Chriſtianity was to rule his Empire in the exaltation of <hi>Conſtantine. Abraham</hi> was in hardſhip out of his Country, when he received the promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, when the Oracles of God were delivered to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41445:25"/> them. Confuſion of the Church precedes alwaies the Communication of Light.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Reaſons of the Doctrine are theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This makes for God's glory.</hi> The creature cannot in this condition challenge any ſhare in the honour of the deliverance, or pare off ſo much as a ſplinter of his glory. Had the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> been armed, and drawn into a ſtrong Battalion, and ſo defeated the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Army, the Victory would rather have been challeng'd by them, than aſcrib'd to God; but neither the ſtrength of their multitude, nor the wiſdom of their Guides, were able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; counſel failed, and heads were feeble; then did God get himſelf a name, when they were upon the point of a remedileſs ruine. It was manifeſt the name of the Lord got <hi>David</hi> the Victory, ſince he encountred unarmed with <hi>Goliah,</hi> who could have cruſht him like a Fly had he been in his fingers.</p>
            <p>The time of the Churches depreſſion, is the time of God's Exaltation; he waits for the extremity to lift up himſelf. When paleneſs is upon the face of his People; when the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> hang their heads; when the Churches beauty ſeems a lamentable deformity, and <hi>Sharon</hi> is like a wilderneſs, then will God ariſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.9, 10. God never builds up <hi>Sion,</hi> but he ordains all things in a method for his appearance in the greateſt glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he ſhall appear in his glory,</hi> that is, when the Church is deſtitute, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God exalts his power;</hi> his <hi>right hand</hi> then becomes <hi>glorious in power, Exod.</hi> 15.6. He loves to appear in his dreſs as a Creator, when there is no fitneſs in the ſubject to anſwer his end, but what he beſtows upon it. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> becomes <hi>a rejoycing, and her People a joy,</hi> 'tis an act of creating power, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.18. <hi>For behold I create</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a rejoycing.</hi> When the creature can give them not the leaſt aſſiſtance, then will they be ſenſible of God's unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficiency, and their own neceſſary dependance. God never had too little help from his creature in a deliverance; he hath ſometimes complain'd of too much, and disbanded ſome of the Churches Forces, as in the caſe of <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 7. As Chriſt rules in the midſt of his Enemies, ſo doth God's Power moſt viſibly in the midſt of diſtreſſes. A Phyſician's skill is moſt conſpicuous when the diſeaſe is moſt dangerous, and moſt complicated, and Nature at the loweſt ebb. 'Tis more glory to God to quench the fire in its fulleſt rage, than to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it in its firſt ſmoke and ſparkles. God loves the faireſt mark to ſhoot at, and will rather down with <hi>Goliah,</hi> than with the ordinary <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> grapple with the great, rather than with a light danger, that the Lord may appear to be <hi>a man of war, Exod.</hi> 15.3. As God ſhews his mercy in his Peoples Redemption, he will ſhew his ſtrength in their conduct, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.13. He that made this deliverance a ſtanding Monument of his Power, entitles himſelf by it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which makes a way in the Sea, a path in the mighty waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His kindneſs to, and care of his People.</hi> When the ſtraits are remedileſs, and the counſels whereby the Projects are laid, not to be defeated by humane skill; when God ſeems to have forgot, then in a ſeaſonable deliverance he ſhews himſelf the careful Watchman of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When the Ship is in a raging ſtorm, and Chriſt aſleep, he will leave his own eaſe to keep his word, and content his People. When the Church thinks God hath forgotten his mercies, and they have forgotten their dependance; when the miſery is ſo preſſing, that there is no faith of a deliverance left, then Chriſt comes, when faith is ſcarcely to be found upon the Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. to exalt his mercy in the depths of their miſery, and work terrible things they looked not for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood God's care in their protection, without this or the like ſtrait. God had a new oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſhew his watchfulneſs over them, to turn the cloud which went before them as their guide, behind them for their defence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19. The ſcoffs of the Enemy at the Churches miſery, are God's motive to help her. <hi>I will reſtore health to thee, becauſe they called thee an out-caſt, Jer.</hi> 30.17. 'Tis in ſtraits we ſee God's ſalvation, not man's, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His Juſtice.</hi> He lets the Church be encompaſſed with miſeries, and the Enemies in a Combination againſt her, that he may overthrow them at once. God makes a quicker diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> when they were united, than when they had aſſaulted <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a ſmaller body: His Righteouſneſs gets glory at one blow, when he makes them to lye down together, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43.17. His Juſtice is unblemiſht in ſtriking when their wickedneſs is viſibly ripe; the equity of it muſt needs be ſubſcribed, that when the Enemies malice is greateſt, when they have no mixture of compaſſion, 'tis the cleareſt righteouſneſs to cruſh them without any mixture of mercy, God brings things to that paſs, that he may honour both his Juſtice and Mercy in the higheſt. That the black horſes, and the white horſes may march firm together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.6. the black horſes that brought death and Judgment Northward to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Church was captive; the white horſes that followed them, and brought deliverance to his People; the one to be Inſtruments of his Judgments, the other of his Mercies. God loves to glorifie thoſe two Attributes together; he did ſo in the redemption of mankind by the death of his Son, and he doth ſo in the deliverance of his Church; there is a conformity of the Church to Chriſt, in her diſtreſs, that there may be a conformity of God's glory in temporal, to his glory in eternal Salvation. God ſingles out a full crop to be an harveſt for both. A wicked man is ſaid to be <hi>waited for</hi> by the ſword, <hi>Job</hi> 15.22. God attends the beſt ſeaſon for revenge; when mercy to the one ſhall appear moſt glorious, and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his Enemies moſt equitable and all diſputes againſt his proceedings be ſilenced.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41445:26"/>2. <hi>It makes to the Churches Advantage.</hi> God had a <hi>work</hi> to do <hi>upon Mount</hi> Sion <hi>and on</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, before he would <hi>puniſh the ſtout heart of the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and the glory of his high looks, Iſa.</hi> 10.12. His end ſhall be attained in the correction of his Church, before his glory ſhall be exalted in the deſtruction of her Enemies. There are Enemies in the hearts of his People to be conquered by his grace, before the Enemies to her peace and proſperity ſhall be defeated by his Power; he will let them be in the fire, till, like gold, they may have a purer honour in a brighter luſtre.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Humiliation is gain'd hereby.</hi> God would not preſently raze out the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> leſt the wild Beaſts ſhould increaſe upon them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.22. Too quick deliverances may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to multiply the wild Beaſts of pride, ſecurity and wantonneſs in the heart; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility would have but little footing. There is need of a ſharp Winter to deſtroy the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, before we can expect a fruitful Spring. Without humiliation the Church knows not how to receive, nor how to improve any mercy. The Enemies haſten their own mine, by increaſing the meaſure of their ſins; and <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance, by being inſtruments to humble then hearts. The ſooner the plaiſter hath drawn out the corrupt matter, the ſooner it is caſt into the fire. God hereby prevents the growth of weeds in that ground he intends to enrich with new mercies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Spirit of Prayer is excited.</hi> Slight troubles make but drooping prayers. Great ſtraits make it guſh out, as the more the bladder is ſqueezed, the higher the water ſprings. We hear not of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> crying to the Lord after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> till they had a ſight of the formidable Army, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10. <hi>They were ſore afraid, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cried unto the Lord.</hi> Prayer gains mercies, but ſcarce ſprings up free without ſence of diſtreſs: We then have recourſe to Gods power whereby he is able to relieve us, when we are ſenſible of our own weakneſs, whereby we are unable to relieve our ſelves; men will ſcarce ſeek to God, or truſt him, while any creature, though but a reed, remains for their ſupport; they are <hi>deſtitute</hi> before they <hi>pray,</hi> or believe God regards their prayers, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 102.17. <hi>He will regard the prayer of the Deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayer.</hi> Diſtreſs cauſes importunity, and God will do much for importunities ſake, <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Diſcovery of ſincerity.</hi> Hereby God diſcovers who are his people, and who are not; who are in the higheſt form of Chriſtianity, and who are not in the School, or at leaſt but in the loweſt form; he ſeparates the good corn from the uſeleſs chaff. No queſtion but there were ſome among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that in this extremity, acted faith upon the remembrance of the wonders God had wrought for them in <hi>Aegypt</hi> before their departure; certainly they did not all murmur againſt <hi>Moſes;</hi> Were there no <hi>Calebs</hi> and <hi>Joſhuahs,</hi> that followed God fully in a way of faith and ſubmiſſion? Their faith &amp; courage had not been conſpicuous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this extremity. Thundrings and Lightnings, and terrible things in righteouſneſs are to prove us, whether the fear of God be before our faces that we ſin not, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18, 20. God ſeparates the droſs. You never know a new building without pulling down, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the rubbiſh, and rotten rafters from the ſound materials. <hi>Abraham</hi> was put upon hard work, the imbruing his hands in the blood of his only Son, to prove his integrity; when God ſees his ſincerity, he divers the blow; not only delivers him from his grief, his Son from his danger, but renews the promiſe of the Meſſiah to him as a reward. Deliverance then comes when God hath ſeparated the Corn from the ſtubble.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A ſtanding encouragement for future faith.</hi> When the ſtraits are greateſt from whence God delivers us, there is a ſtronger foundation for a future truſt. When the diſtreſs is inconſiderable, faith afterwards will be more feeble; large experience heartens &amp; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens faith in the promiſe. When gloomy clouds are blown over, the brighter and thinner will not be much feared. When we ſee the Sun melt the thickeſt over our heads, we ſhall not doubt its force to diſolve the leſſer vapours which may afterwards aſſemble; when the Ship hath eſcaped a raging ſtorm, we ſhall not doubt it in a leſs. God often puts them in mind of their deliverance in the red Sea, to ſtrengthen their faith, and dependance on him. It muſt needs be an eſtabliſhment to faith; for deliverances from great ſtraits are ſome kind of obligation on the honour of God. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had provoked God by murmuring, and wiſhed they had dyed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and not in the wilderneſs, <hi>Moſes</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes with this argument, The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſhall hear of it, from whom God brought up <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> with a ſtrong hand, and it would diſparage Gods power, and tax him with an inability to bring his people into the Land he intended; then God grants their pardon, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.13, 14, 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Engagement to future Obedience.</hi> 'Tis upon this account God prefaceth the Law with his mercy in delivering them out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The ſtrongeſt Vows are made in the greateſt ſtraits. Many obligations there are when the extremity forces us to cry. When we are in the Jaws of Death, God may have his terms of us; when we are at ſome diſtance, we will have our own. The lower a perſon is, the more readily will he bend to any condition; hope of deliverance will make him ſtoop. And when God ſnatches his People as fire-brands out of the fire, they are more obliged to him from common ingenuity, and muſt be more aſhamed of breaking their Vows, than if their mercies were of a great alloy. If common patience leads to repentance, a reſcue from an amazing danger is a ſtronger cord to draw us to repentance and obedience. And it is certain, that when the Church in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41445:26"/> makes Vows to God, it will not be long before God puts her into a condition to pay them; and furniſh her with Incentives of a holy ingenuity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The greater thankfulneſs.</hi> The more ſtraitned, the greater thankfulneſs for enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As we hear not of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> prayers after they came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> till they were in the pound, ſo we read of none of their ſongs, though they had matter enough for them, in their firſt departure, till God had daſht in pieces the Enemy, and <hi>thrown the Horſe and the Rider into the Sea.</hi> Then, and not till then, had they a deep ſenſe, how <hi>glorious</hi> God was <hi>in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders, Exod.</hi> 15.11. Great mercies unvail God's face more to the view of his People. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> inherits great ſalvation, then the Lord ſhall inherit the praiſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When we have leſs mercies, we take little notice of the Author; God hears the language of but one of our bones; but when he <hi>delivers the poor from him that is too ſtrong for him, and ſpoils him,</hi> then <hi>all my bones ſhall ſay, Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>To prevent future miſchief to the Church.</hi> The deſtruction of the greateſt Enemies is a diſarming the leſs. God by this deſtruction ſtruck a terrour into thoſe Nations upon whoſe confines <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to march into <hi>Canaan,</hi> who without ſo remarkable a rebuke of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would have been deſirous to finger ſome of their prey. Then <hi>trembling took hold of the mighty men of</hi> Moab. <hi>All the Inhabitants of</hi> Canaan <hi>did melt away; fear and dread fell upon them by the greatneſs of the Arm of God,</hi> that they ſhould be as <hi>ſtill as a ſtone, till they paſſed over</hi> the River, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.15, 16. Their preſent deliverance was a Paſs-port for their future ſecurity in their Journey; and no Enemies troubled them in the way, but thoſe upon whom God had a mind to ſhew his Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How doth God deliver when the ſeaſon is thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Suddenly.</hi> They ſank <hi>like Lead</hi> in the mighty waters, which quickly reaches the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Judgment comes like lightning. Death and Hell are ſaid to ride <hi>upon Horſes, Rev.</hi> 6.8. They are too ſwift for God's Enemies, and will eaſily win the Race of them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes, <hi>as travel upon a woman with child,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. How ſuddenly did God turn the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp into an <hi>Aceldema,</hi> overthrow a powerful Army, and make their Tents their Tombs in the ſpace of a night? He will daſh them <hi>in pieces like a Potters Veſſel, Pſa.</hi> 2.9. all in bits at a ſtroke: He comes ſuddenly; he <hi>rides upon a Cherub, Pſal.</hi> 18.10. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the motion of an Angel is not ſo intelligible, he adds another Metaphor from the nimbleſt of ſenſible things; <hi>he flies upon the wings of the wind,</hi> to aſſiſt his People in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. The Enemy comes like a <hi>whirlwind</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">They came out as a whirlwind to ſcatter me, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.14.</note>, and God goes forth as a <hi>whirlwind</hi> of fury, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.23. The whirlwind of his Judgments ſhall be as quick as the whirlwind of their malice; a continual whirlwind, when the other is vaniſhing; it <hi>ſhall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked,</hi> when the other ſhall be as fruitleſs as a Snow-ball againſt a wall of Braſs. The Enemy beholds him not till he be upon him; for <hi>the clouds are as duſt under his feet, Nahum</hi> 1.3. and obſcure his appearance, as the raiſing the Duſt doth the march of a Troop; he comes unawares upon them in a Cloud. The Execution is ſudden; They ſhall be <hi>cut down as graſs, Pſal.</hi> 37.2. which this moment faceth the Sun, triumphing in its natural bravery, and the next moment is cut off from its Root with one ſhave of a Sythe. He quencheth them as Tow is quencht in Water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.17. as the ſnuff of a Candle is quench'd by being bruis'd by the fingers. He cuts them off as foam, the excrement of the water, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.7. which burſts in pieces like a bubble, on the ſudden. Vengeance comes upon <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> ſwiftly and ſpeedily, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.4. <hi>Tyre</hi> comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, the word ſignifies to purſue. All Perſecutors are threatned in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> with a ſwift deſtruction. God delays the time to try the faith and patience of his People, to make the expected deliverance more ſweet and welcom, and mercy more ſingular. He may have ſome of the ſeed of Chriſt in the loins of ſome of his Enemies. But when he doth draw his Sword, he gives a ſudden blow before the Enemy fears it, or his People expect it. The Jews in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the Chains of their Captivity were unlooſed, were like thoſe that dream, they could ſcarce believe they were freed, when the Enemy felt himſelf puniſh'd. In all other Plagues God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> as an Herauld, with warning to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but in this God ſurpriſed him, and hurried him to deſtruction, without giving him any caution; Like <hi>chaff that the Tempeſt carrieth away,</hi> and is ſeen no more, <hi>Job</hi> 21.18. So ſhall the Plagues of ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt</hi> come <hi>in one day, Rev.</hi> 18.8. yea, in <hi>one hour, v.</hi> 17. And the Church ſhall be like a Lilly, which by the aſſiſtance of the Dew, flouriſheth in the morning, when over night it looked as if it were withered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Magnificently.</hi> Sometimes in deliverance God puts the frame of nature in confuſion, He <hi>melts the mountains, cleaves the vallies, as wax before the fire and as waters poured down a ſteep place, Mic.</hi> 1.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> He waſts the ſtrength and riches of his enemies when he comes to judge. When he appears in the generation of the righteous, he ſhall appear in ſuch glory, as to make the adverſaries in great fear, and ſtrike a terrour into them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.5. God will perform it in a prodigious and unuſual way. God might have taken off the wheels of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Chariots before they had entred the gap of the Sea, and hindred them from approaching ſo near his beloved people; he might have afflicted their hands with the palſy, and rendred them uncapable to manage their weapons; or might have ſent a ſpirit of aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among them and made them ſheath their ſwords in one anothers bowels. But though this had ſecured his people, it would not have rendred his operation ſo illuſtrious, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41445:27"/> that which was a means of his peoples ſecurity, to be his Enemies deſtruction, and the waters at once Indulgent to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſevere to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> He magnifies his Judgments and mercies by one and the ſame ſtroak, and drowns the Enemies, in the Sea, whereby he delivers the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> So he preſerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the midſt of thoſe Lions which devoured his accuſers. The more contrary things are to an eye of reaſon, the fitter ſubjects they are for the exaltation of God. As Chriſt the head, ſo the Church the body is raiſed out of the grave by the glory of God the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. His right hand ſhall find his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8. his <hi>right hand ſhall teach him terrible things, Pſa.</hi> 45.4. Then ſhall he come with a ſhout, as one refreſhed with wine, recruited with new Spirits, and riſen from ſleep, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.65. He calls upon all creatures to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the deſign of his peoples deliverance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.8. He will perfect it by a way of creation. (<hi>I have created righteouſneſs</hi> to deliverance) with the manifeſtation of a creative power, &amp; he makes things ſerve againſt their natural order appointed by God. Thus, when God ſhall appear for the final overthrow of ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he ſhall come with Voices, Thunders and Lightnings, an earthquake out of the temple, and appear as magnificently in the garb of a Judge, as he did on <hi>Sinai</hi> in that of a Law-giver, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. and make the Ten horns, which were the ſupport of the beaſt, to be the Inſtruments of her deſolation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Severely. They ſank to the bottom like lead in the mighty waters.</hi> God ſends out the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Judgments againſt thoſe that deal ſharply with his people greater than againſt any other part of the world, <hi>Zac.</hi> 6.6. The black horſes, the inſtrument of the execution of his Anger, were ſent towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> where his people were in Captivity; but the bay horſes of a mixt colour, noting a mixture of Mercy and Judgments, are ſent towards other parts of the world, to walk, not to run, ſignifying the patience of God to thoſe parts which had not yet oppreſt his people; God deals not ſo ſmartly with thoſe, as with them that are Enemies to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In ſuch concerns he anſwers his people <hi>by terrible things in righteouſneſs:</hi> When he appears as a God of Salvation to his people, he appears terrible in his righteouſneſs to his Enemies, Pſa. 65.5. <hi>By terrible things in righteouſneſs wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our Salvation.</hi> His Judgments ſhall be as terrible as they are righteous. The executioners of his vengeance ride upon horſes, to ſhew their readineſs to any warlike ingagement; upon red horſes of a bloody colour, to ſhew the ſeverity of their commiſſion againſt the Enemies of God, <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.8. He will pay all arrears together, that they ſhall be forced to ſay, God is true to the word of his threatning, as well as that of his promiſe, As the Amalekites in <hi>Samuel's</hi> time payed the ſcores of their Anceſtors in the time of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> travel through the wilderneſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2. <hi>I remember that which</hi> Amalek <hi>did to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>how he laid wait for him in the way when they came up from</hi> Aegypt. So when God reckons with <hi>Babylon</hi> for all the bloud of the Saints &amp; Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The bloud of all the Prophets and Saints that were ſlain upon the earth, ſhall be found upon her skirts and avenged on her;</hi> and gives unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath, all that ſhe hath done ſhall come into his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. And how ſevere it ſhall be is expreſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.19, 20. ſhe ſhall be caſt into the <hi>great wine-preſs of the wrath of God,</hi> as grapes bruiſed with the greateſt ſtrength, and cruſhed in pieces both skin &amp; ſtones. And to expreſs it more ſenſibly to our underſtandings, he ſpeaks of the flowing of the <hi>bloud out of the wine-preſs unto the horſe bridles,</hi> by the ſpace of a 1000 <hi>and</hi> 600 <hi>furlongs,</hi> two hundred miles; not that we ſhould underſtand it literally, but the Spirit of God is ſo particular in deſcribing the height of the deluge of bloud to the bridles of the horſes, the length of the floud to the ſpace of two hundred Miles, to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our apprehenſion the ſeverity of the wrath that ſhall be poured out upon them. And as God never repented of his Judgments upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo never will he of thoſe which are to come upon <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally;</hi> and therefore ſeverely. <hi>The horſe and the rider did God caſt into the Sea;</hi> the Chariots, the Hoſt, and the choſen Captains were drowned there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 4. The waters covered the Enemy, there was not one of them left, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 60.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.28. Not a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to carry back the news; their floating bodies and wracks were the firſt that gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the defeat to their remaining countrymen. God throws off all tenderneſs, his bowels are ſilent, he ſtrikes like a wrathful Enemy, lanceth not like a tender Chyrurgion; ſo ſhall it be with their partners in their ſins, every man that worſhips the Beaſt and his Image ſhall drink of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and whoever receiveth the mark of his name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. The Sun, the political power that defends it, ſhall be darkened; the rivers, whereby their traffick and riches come in to them, ſhall be dried up; all that have any dependance on them, recourſe to them, ſtand in the defence of the power of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſhall fall under the indignation of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Totally;</hi> Irrecoverably. They ſank <hi>as lead.</hi> God will make <hi>an utter end, Affliction ſhall not riſe up a</hi> 2d <hi>time, Nahum</hi> 1.9, 10, He overtakes them when they are drunk in the height of their pleaſure, while they are making their confederacies againſt the Church, while <hi>they are ſolden together like thorns, they ſhall be devoured like ſtubble fully dry.</hi>

Their former plagues had ſomething of patience; Puniſhment was inflicted, but life preſerved; Judgments
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41445:27"/> ſent, but upon promiſe of reformation quite removed: Now Patience folds her hands, and ſtands Spectator, while Juſtice opens hers, and becomes a ſole actor; mercy runs on the ſide of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and wrath marcheth without any Impediment againſt the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> As they like lead, ſo irrecoverably ſhall <hi>Babylon</hi> fall like a milſtone, in the depths of the Sea, and ſhall be found no more at all; all her mirth and jollity ſhall for ever ceaſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.21, 22, 23. When things fall to the bottom of the Sea, they are entombed there for ever, no skill can reſtore them to their former ſtation; when judgment turneth the key, and locks them in, there is no more opening the door.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>And all this juſtly. Pharaoh</hi> had commanded that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Male-children ſhould be expoſed to the mercy of the River, to find their death in the water as ſoon as they had breathed in the Air, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.22. And God makes them periſh in that Element, to which they had adjudged the harmleſs Infants. Now God pays the Law-maker, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers with the ſame Coin, and makes the Malefactors food for the Inhabitants of the deep, who had before fed the Crocodiles with the blood of the Innocent. God ſhall reward <hi>Babylon</hi> as ſhe hath rewarded his people, and double unto her the cup ſhe hath filled for others, <hi>Rev</hi> 18.6. Upon this account ſhall praiſe be given to God, that he hath given them bloud to drink, who have ſhed the blood of his Saints and Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6. Thou <hi>art righteous O Lord, becauſe thou haſt judged thus.</hi> As ſhe hath kindled fires to conſume the witneſſes of Chriſt, ſo God ſhall kindle a fire to conſume her, Rev. 17.16. <hi>She ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, Rev.</hi> 18.8. Some think <hi>Rome</hi> will at length be conſumed with fire from Heaven; ſhe is indeed Spiritual <hi>Sodom, Rev.</hi> 11.8. And as ſhe anſwers it in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Spiritual ſins, ſhe may partake of the ſame viſible and Spiritual Judgments: Whether the puniſhment will be the ſame for kind I know not, but certainly it will be ſuch a kind of puniſhment whereby the judgments of God ſhall be read both in proportion, and kind of it, as a retaliation for her ſins; and the Scripture ſpeaks of fire coming down from God out of heaven upon the laſt Enemies of the Church, that ſhall Afflict the beloved City, alluding to the fire upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and that which deſcended upon the Perſecutors of <hi>Elijah, Rev.</hi> 20.9.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Wiſely. He cuts off the Spirits of princes,</hi> as he took off the Wheels of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 76.12. Either by infatuating their Counſels, or turning them as the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into other Channels. He ſtript the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Firſt of their wealth, and now Spoyls them of their ſtrength; he kept a bridle upon the waters, till the Enemies were got into the midſt of them, and then commands the Sea to ſwallow them up in the depths of her bowels. When men lay their Counſels deep, ſecond them by an invincible ſtrength, have almoſt brought them to their imagin'd period ready to bring forth, God diſappoints their hopes baffles their Counſels, renders their projects frothy, raiſeth a ſtorm and blows the ſhip from its harbour, contrary to its intended courſe, and glorifies his wiſdom, by overthrowing their deſigns, when they have brought them to a birth. He watches upon the evil to divert it from the innocent object upon the malicious actor. As God watches for the fitteſt ſeaſon to bring evil upon his people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.14. he will be as diligent to watch for the fitteſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring Judgment on his Enemies. God hath promiſed vengeance, but he hath reſerved the knowledg of the <hi>due time</hi> to himſelf, when he will make their <hi>foot to ſlide, Deut.</hi> 32.35. Every mercy is then moſt ſeaſonable. Uſually God lets men bring the ball almoſt to the goal, and then kicks it from them, and them from it: And the wiſdom of God hath been, and will be glorious in the overthrow of the remaining Enemies of the Church, in making them which were horns to defend the Beaſt, to be carpenters to ruine him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16.</p>

When God was engaged in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his people, he ſinks the ſtrength of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> rather than one hair of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heads ſhould periſh; they went ſafe over, while no man or horſe of the Enemies eſcap't. God gave <hi>Aegypt</hi> for <hi>Iſraels</hi> ranſom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3. And the Sea ſhould have drowned the whole Land, rather than the Enemies have hurt his People. So did the contrivers of the Powder-Plot come to deſtruction, when not one hair of a head was loſt, or one ſplinter of the place they intended was ſhav'd off, by the prepared Gunpowder. God ſits in Heaven, and laughs at the little petty Deſigns of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4. God that is infinite to countermine them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely powerful to defeat them, hath them in deriſion. Chriſt in glory mocks at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of earth-worms. The Decree of God, which ſettles Chriſt a King, aſſures him a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſecures his People as it did his Perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. God is <hi>a Sun and a Shield; Pſal.</hi> 84.11. a Shield to defend them, and a Sun to extinguiſh the fire of the Enemies fury, by ſhining upon it. God values no Nation for the ſecurity of his People. The <hi>Babylonians,</hi> a warlike Nation, ſhall ſink under the Army of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the Reſtauration of the captive Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. <hi>I will give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi> He had given <hi>Aegypt</hi> for their Ranſom before, and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Seba,</hi> in the time of <hi>Aſa;</hi> and ſtill in after Ages God was of the ſame mind. God is as gracious to his People, as terrible to his Enemies: He is light to the one, when he is fire to the ſouls and bodies of the other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.17. Chriſt ſtill ſits the Watchman of <hi>Ephraim</hi> with God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.8. He inſpects his Church, and waits to bring the day of Viſitation upon his Enemies. The Covenant is of ſpecial force with God to move him to deliver his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8. He ſaid, <hi>Surely they are my People, ſo he was their Saviour.</hi> It ſeems to refer to the deliverance from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Shall I have ſo little regard to the League I have entred into with their Fathers, as to be unconcern'd in their miſery?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41445:28"/> There is hope in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till God forgets his Covenant, and Chriſt ſtrip himſelf of the name of a Saviour. Chriſt hath his Prieſtly habit in Heaven for his People, but Eyes as flames of fire, quick and piercing, to conſume the very hearts of his Enemies; and Feet like fine Braſs, to trample upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. He is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> to tear his Enemies, as well as a Lamb ſlain, to expiate the ſins of his People. He hath meekneſs for his Friends, and terrible Majeſty for his Enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.4. <hi>In thy Majeſty ride proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, becauſe of meekneſs.</hi> His kindneſs to his People makes him ride in Majeſty againſt the others. God will not be at reſt till he hath revenged the Cauſe of his People. <hi>Aegypt</hi> will be drowned, <hi>Babylon</hi> will fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. Chriſt can have no ſatisfaction without it. The Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of his Judgments in the North Country, which was <hi>Babylon,</hi> lying Northward from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> do quiet his Spirit; both as tending to the glory of his Juſtice, and the manifeſtation of his Mercy to his People, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.3. Chriſt will ſtain his garments in the blood of <hi>Edom,</hi> and <hi>Bozra, Iſa.</hi> 63.2, 3. <hi>Edom</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau, Bozra</hi> a City of <hi>Moab,</hi> Types of the Churches Enemies. The Jewiſh Doctors by <hi>Edom</hi> in the Prophets underſtand <hi>Rome.</hi> Chriſt ſits in Heaven, <hi>till his Enemies be made his footſtool.</hi> All the time of his ſitting God is acting and preparing things for a final Iſſue. There is a ſtrong cry of Blood, and a file of Prayers; the one will be revenged, and the other will be anſwer'd. Their own pride and cruelty witneſs againſt them. God hath a noiſe of Petitions every day for a full end; a combin'd importunity will prevail. But clouds now hang over us, a gloomy ſtorm ſeems to threaten us. God may indeed blow over the cloud. Our Saviour hath the command of the ſtorms and winds in Heaven, as well as he had upon the Earth; the Pillar of the cloud, which hath hitherto conducted us, may be our Guardian in the Rear to defend us. But yet if he doth ſuffer them to prevail, they ſhall be but as Whisks to bruſh off the duſt, wiſps of Straw to cleanſe the filthy Pot. You know what is to be done with them, when their work is done. Their Language indeed is, <hi>Let Sion be defiled;</hi> but they underſtand not the counſel of the Lord, who in time will make the Horn of <hi>Sion</hi> Iron, and her Hoofs Braſs, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.11. Though the Beaſts that aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit do kill God's People, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. yet even in this Victory of theirs Satan himſelf ſhall be overcome. As when Chriſt was taken out from among the living by Satans means, it was but for a time; but himſelf was caſt out for ever; ſo after this Victory the Church ſhall overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and God ſhall break the head of the Leviathan in the waters; and when he doth by his wiſdom contrive waies of ſalvation, he will by his power execute them, and ſave in ſuch a way as may moſt glorifie himſelf, and witneſs that the ſalvation was the immediate work of his arm, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will ſave them by the Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Remember former deliverances in time of ſtraits.</hi> In our plenty of mercies we ſhould not be unmindful how near we were to the Pit, nor let the impreſſion of God's power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and mercy wear off from our hearts. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were apt to forget the moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies, though they had ſeen them, and had more ſenſibly taſted the ſweetneſs of them, than their Poſterity. God therefore often puts them in mind of them; The Lord that brought them <hi>out of the Land of Aegypt,</hi> out of the <hi>Iron Furnace, Deut.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.9. <hi>I the Lord your God from the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.3. It was the more fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by them, becauſe many of them were fitter ſubjects for God's wrath with the Aegyptians, than for his delivering-kindneſs, ſince <hi>ſhe committed whoredoms in</hi> Aegypt <hi>in her youth, i. e.</hi> had been guilty of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Idolatry. Unmindfulneſs of former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences may make you hopeleſs of future deliverances: The remembrance of former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is a ground of confidence in God for the like mercies for the future. God recalls to his Peoples minds, in their afflictions, the memorable defeat of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> by his ſole power, in the time of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s Reign; they ſhould from that deliverance hope for as great from the hands of God in their ſtraits. And <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.11. God would have them conſider their deliverance at the Red Sea, as a ground of hope in the time of their diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thankfully remember former deliverances.</hi> If we have not ſome praiſe for God, we may ſuſpect our ſelves.<note n="*" place="margin">Lightfoot Temple, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> 'Tis obſerved that the City <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> the Royal ſeat of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, was pourtrayed upon the eaſt gate of the temple, not becauſe of the <hi>Perſian</hi> command, or becauſe of their fear of that King, as ſome think; but to have a thankful remembrance of the wonderful deliverance of <hi>Purim,</hi> which was wrought in <hi>Shuſhan, Eſth.</hi> 9.26. If it had been only by the <hi>Perſians</hi> command, it would have been defaced after the fall of that Monarchy, which held but thirty four years after the building of the ſecond Temple. The 136. <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a good Copy, where is a threefold exhortation to thankfulneſs, in the beginning, and one at the end, and in the record of every mercy the burden of every verſe is, <hi>his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> How ſhould we imitate the Pſalmiſt? He broke the teeth of the invincible <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> in 88, and ſent a ſtrong wind to diſperſe the Fleet, <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever;</hi> God prevented the dreadful blaſt of Gun-powder, for <hi>his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> God ſent the light of the Goſpel into <hi>England,</hi> and freed it from the yoke of Antichriſts ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, <hi>for his mercy endures for ever.</hi> God hath been a wall of fire about <hi>Ireland</hi> in the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, for <hi>his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Let mercy receive the praiſe of what our own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power could not effect. The way to overcome the ſame Enemies we fear, is to praiſe God for what he hath before acted againſt them. The ſtrength of a people conſiſts in praiſes, as well as praying, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41445:28"/> ſtrength.</hi> In the Evangeliſt, <hi>thou haſt perfected praiſe, Mat.</hi> 21.16. The more <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> we put up, the more occaſion God may give us for them. If we have any fears of the overflowing deluge, God formerly delivered us from, our non-improvement of thoſe deliverances, the fruits whereof we enjoy this day, may ſtrengthen our fears. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Idolatrous in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> reign, yet God delivered them from the <hi>Syrians,</hi> becauſe he ſaw their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was bitter, and there was no helper, yet when they did not thankfully improve it to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, God denounced judgments againſt them for their Idolatry, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.26, 27. <hi>The Lord ſaid not that he would blot out the name of</hi> Iſrael; So that he had not yet denounced it, for he waited to ſee the improvement of this mercy. But before the end of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> reign by the prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> who began to propheſy in his time, he declared their final cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, from whence they are not reſtored to this day. Praiſe for former mercies is a means to gain future ones; the Muſick of Voices in <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> camp, praiſing the beauty of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, was a prologue of a deliverance from a formidable army, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21, 22. and more ſucceſsful than the warlike muſick of drums and trumpets.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Exerciſe faith on the power of God manifeſted in deliverances in the time of ſtraits.</hi> 'Tis not for want of ability in God, but for want of faith in us, that we at any time go groaning under miſery; Faith would quiet the Soul: When <hi>David</hi> relyed upon God, and found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience God ſuſtaining him, he would not then be afraid of ten thouſand, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 3.5, 6. Let that be our carriage which is recorded of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after this memorable defeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. <hi>They believed the Lord; and his Servant</hi> Moſes. We muſt never expect to ſee Gods arm bare, without faith in him. Chriſt can do no great work, where unbelief is predominant. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief doth not ſtrip God of his power, and mercy, but it ſtops the ſtreams and effluxes of it. Unbelief againſt experience is a double ſin; 'Tis groſs when againſt a bare word, worſe when againſt the word confirmed by a Witneſs. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was paſt thoughts of any relief in this ſtrait, but expected to periſh by the hand of their Enemies, yet God brought them into ſtraits in mercy, to bring them out of ſtraits with power; he makes their diſtreſs a ſnare to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and a ſcaffold for their faith. That deliverance ought to be a foundation for our truſt in God, though beſtowed upon another Nation, yet not ſo much upon them as a State, but as a Church, and a type of thoſe future ones under the Goſpel, which are yet expected. Well then, truſt upon this foundation. Great truſt in God is a ſort of obligation upon God: Men out of generoſity will do much for them that depend upon them. Dependance on God magnifies his Attributes, this will bring deliverance, whereby God will magnify himſelf. Do not diſtruſt him, till you meet with an Enemy too ſtrong for him to quell, a red Sea too deep for him to divide, an affliction too ſturdy for him to rebuke, an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> too proud for him to maſter; Then part with your faith, but not till God hath parted with his power, which he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly evidenc'd.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Expect and provide for ſharp conflicts.</hi> God brings into ſtraits before he delivers; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other deliverance is yet to come; the Churches diſtreſſes are not come to a period, <hi>Babylon</hi> hath another game to play. The right of the Devil to tyrannize over the Myſtical Body was taken away at the death of the head, yet he ſtill bruiſeth Chriſts heel, and bites, though he cannot totally overcome. As long as Chriſts Enemies are not made his foot-ſtool, as long as there is the ſeed of the Serpent in the World, as long as Chriſts members want a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the head, <hi>Satans</hi> pinches muſt be expected; as long as the Beaſt is in being, he will make war with the followers of the Lamb; his power is to continue forty two months, to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.5, 7. Forty two months or years. 'Tis like the time is not expir'd: One thouſand ſix hundred and twenty years, which make forty two months; no ending ſince he firſt had his power; when his time draws near to an end, he will bite ſharpeſt. This deliverance from <hi>Aegypt</hi> is yet again to be acted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that muſt be at the end, when the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God ſhall be freed from Anti-chriſt, the Antitype of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Yet let us not be afraid.</hi> Apoſtacies may be great; there will be but two Witneſſes; not two in number, but in regard of the fewneſs of thoſe that ſhall bear teſtimony to the Doctrine of Chriſt: there may be no Advocate for the Church: <hi>Sion</hi> may be an out-caſt, caſt out of the affection of many that ſerved or favoured her: But the ſharpeſt Convulſions in the world are preſages of an approaching Redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. and the Goſpel will ſhine clearer, as the Sun doth, after it hath been muffled with a thick Cloud. The words in the mouths of the Witneſſes, will be moſt killing and convincing. Fear not a natural above a ſupernatural Power. Was not all the Church God had in the world in as low a condition at the Red Sea? Not a Soul, that we read of, exempt (or but few, as <hi>Job,</hi> and ſome few others in other parts) yet the Church was then delivered for a Pattern, to ſhew forth the power of God in the Ages to come. What though there may be a want of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Are not all Inſtruments out-liv'd by God? Has God diſmiſt the care of his People? Is he not alwaies the Churches Guardian? He muſt be dethron'd, before he can be diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. While Heaven is too high for humane hands to reach, the Church is too well guarded for them to conquer: Fear not, till Chriſt lets his Scepter fall out of his hands, and ceaſes to rule in the midſt of his Enemies, and flings away the Keys of Death and Hell; fear not till God ſtrips himſelf of his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> wherewith he is <hi>clothed; He is clothed with ſtrength, Pſal.</hi> 93.1. Though there be little ſtrength in the Church, there is an Almighty one in their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41445:29"/>
'Tis no matter what the Enemy reſolves againſt what God ordains. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy, God intended to deliver. God will have his will, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s luſt goes un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſatisfied. When the Enemies are moſt numerous, God ſhall darken their glory and ſtrength, and then ſhall he be the hope and ſtrength of his People, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. The Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> the Valley of the ſharpeſt trouble, ſhall be a door of hope, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. That God, that can create a World out of nothing, can create deliverance when there is no viſible means to produce it. What can be too hard for him that can work without materials, that can make matter when it is wanting, and call Non-Entities into being? He created the World with a word, and can deſtroy the ſturdieſt men in the world with a look. The ſtrongeſt Devil trembles before him, and the whole Seed of the Serpent is but as the duſt of the ballance before the breath of his mouth. He looked the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Hoſt into diſorder, and their Chariot-wheels into a falling-ſickneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.24. He created the World by a word: He reſtored <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by a word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.26, 27. diſpirited <hi>Aegypt</hi> by a look. There is no need of an Arm; a word, and a look of Omnipotency will be effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious both for the one and the other; one Royal Edict from him will perform it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Thou art my King, command deliverance for</hi> Jacob. He hath Authority as a King, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement as the Churches King: As he hath right of Dominion, ſo he hath an Office of Protection, which the Church of right may claim; and is it <hi>Jacob</hi> that wants deliverance? be not afraid, but ſanctifie the <hi>Lord of Hoſts himſelf, Iſa.</hi> 8.12, 13. To truſt in his Power, is to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his name, and regard him as the Soveraign of all creatures, and the Lord of Hoſts. If we ſanctifie his name by relying on his Power, he will ſanctifie his name by engaging his Power.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To this end <hi>ſtudy the Promiſes God hath made to his Church, and what Predictions are upon Record.</hi> 'Tis a title of the faithful, that they are ſuch as keep the ſayings of the Book of the <hi>Revelation, Rev.</hi> 22.9. The Angel that came to <hi>John,</hi> owns himſelf his <hi>fellow-ſervant;</hi> and <hi>of the Prophets, and thoſe that keep the ſayings of that Book.</hi> See God's Bond, and behold his witneſs; compare the promiſe, the prophecy, and performance: See his mercy in making them, his truth in performing them; let theſe be as the <hi>Hur</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſupport the glory of God in our Souls. This will be a matter of praiſe, and furniſh us with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſpread before God. <hi>Daniel</hi> firſt looked into the Book for the ſet time of the Jews return from <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 9.2. and took his riſe for pleas from thence. You may have need of this food; a Divine Promiſe is the beſt Cordial at a <hi>Stake or Gibbet,</hi> or when a Sword is at your breaſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>When a time of ſtraits comes, wait patiently upon God:</hi> Let not hope ſink, when reaſon is non-pluſt by ſtorms, and ſees nothing but wracks. Wait upon God in the way of his Judgments, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. in his ſtorms as well as calms. God waits to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and therefore we ſhould wait to be gratified. Not to wait, is to be partners in that ſin which brought deſtruction upon the Churches Enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> pride. It concerns God more in point of his glory, to haſten deliverance in its due time, than us in point of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; but there is as much danger in coming too ſoon, as too late. By waiting we imitate the higheſt pattern, who waits with patience for the Reformation of his Enemies, and Chriſt who waits for the total Victory. The longer God keeps the Church at any time under the Enemies Chains, the ſweeter will be his mercy to the one, and the ſeverer his Juſtice on the other. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> waited, and God followed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with Plagues, as he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them with burdens, and took his time to cut off their Oppreſſors with moſt glory to himſelf, and moſt comfort to them. The Viſion hath its appointed time: Impatience will not make God break the Chains of his Reſolves, but Patience will bring down the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with great ſucceſs, and big with noble Births. God is not out of the way of his wiſdom and grace, and we can never keep in our way but by patience in waiting: By this we give him the honour of his wiſdom; by too much haſtineſs we check and controul him, and will not let him be the Maſter and Conductor of his own bleſſings. We many times get more good by waiting, than we do by enjoying a mercy: Such a poſture keeps the Soul humble and believing, whereas many times when we receive a mercy too haſtily with one hand, we let go faith and humility with the other. Sincere Souls have the ſtrongeſt and moſt heavenly raptures in a time of waiting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>They mount up with wings like Eagles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. In times of ſuch ſtraits, <hi>Be found only in a way of duty.</hi> If our ſtraits ſhould ever prove as hard as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the red Sea, <hi>i. e.</hi> have ſomething of a reſemblance to their caſe, let us follow <hi>Moſes</hi> his counſel to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Stand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> Let us not anticipate Gods gracious deſigns; if we will have our finger, where God only will have his arm, God may withdraw this arm and leave us to the weakneſs of our own fingers. Let them that want a God to relieve them, uſe ſinful, and unworthy ſhifts for their deliverance. If any ſucceſs be found out of the way of duty, it may be attended with a curſe, and want that favour of God which only can Sanctify it; We may purchaſe a preſent deliverance with a more durable plague at the end of it, becauſe we forfeit that favour which only can work a real freedom. Sinful ways do not glorify God, but diſparage him; our actions at ſuch a time particularly ſhould adorn the goſpel, not diſcredit it, for it is by the Sword of his mouth that ſuch enemies will be deſtroyed, and every Sword cuts beſt when it is ſharpeſt and cleaneſt, not when it is blunt and ruſty. Not but that lawful means may, nay they muſt be uſed. <hi>Noah,</hi> though he went into the ark by Gods command,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41445:29"/> and was not to ſtir out without his order, yet he ſets open the windows, and ſends forth a <hi>Raven</hi> and a <hi>Dove</hi> to bring him notice when the waters were dryed up. 'Tis a fooliſh thing to offend God who only can help us in our ſtraits, and by our ſin to hold his Sword in his ſheath, which upon our obedience would be drawn for our relief. We know not how ſoon we may need him, and our diſtreſs be ſuch, that none but he can bring Salvation; let no ſin be a bar in the way.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Be much in prayer. Iſrael</hi> cryed unto the Lord before God did relieve, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10. The perſecuted Church cryed travelling in birth, and found a ſecurity both for her ſelf and her off-ſpring, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The diſtreſs of the time is an argument to be uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.34. <hi>Have mercy upon us Lord, for we are exceedingly filled with Contempt.</hi> When Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are high, and acceſs to God free, 'tis an high contempt of God not to uſe the priviledge he allows us; and 'tis to truſt in an arm of fleſh rather than an arm of Omnipotence; to think him either inexorable, or unable. And for encouragement conſider, you have Chriſt arm'd againſt his Spouſes Enemies, and provided with merit to make her prayers ſucceſsful. Our prayers may at laſt be turned into praiſes: And we may ſay with <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Oh thou enemy, deſtructions are come to a perpetual end.</hi>

            <p>THis Pſalm in the beginning is a heap of Inſtructions: The great Leſſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in it is plac'd in <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evil doers, neither be thou envious againſt the workers of iniquity.</hi> 'Tis reſum'd <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8. where many Reaſons are alledged to enforce it.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do not envy them.</hi> Be not troubled at their proſperity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Do not imitate them.</hi> Be not provoked by their Glow-worm happineſs, to practice the ſame wickedneſs to arrive to the ſame proſperity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be not ſinfully impatient and quarrel, not with God,</hi> becauſe he hath not by his providence allowed thee the ſame meaſures of proſperity in the world. Accuſe him not of injuſtice and cruelty, becauſe he afflicts the good, and is indulgent to the wicked. Leave him to diſpenſe his bleſſings according to his own mind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Condemn not the way of Piety and Religion wherein thou art.</hi> Think not the worſe of thy Profeſſion, becauſe it is attended with Affliction.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this Exhortation is rendred <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>For they ſhall ſoon be cut down as the graſs, and wither as the green herb;</hi> amplified by a ſimilitude or reſemblance of their proſperity to graſs: Their happineſs hath no ſtability; it hath like graſs, more of colour and ſhow, than ſtrength and ſubſtance. Graſs nods this and that way with every wind. The mouth of a Beaſt may pull it up, or the foot of a Beaſt may tread it down; the ſcorching Sun in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or the fainting Sun in Winter, will deface its complexion.</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt then proceeds to poſitive duties, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith. Truſt in the Lord.</hi> This is a grace moſt fit to quell ſuch impatiencies. The ſtronger the faith, the weaker the paſſion. Impatient motions are ſigns of a flagging faith. Many times Men are ready to caſt off their help in <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and addreſs to the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> multitudes of friends or riches. But <hi>truſt</hi> thou <hi>in the Lord;</hi> in the promiſes of God, in the providence of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obedience. Do good.</hi> Truſt in God's promiſes, and obſervance of his precepts muſt be linkt together. 'Tis but a pretended truſt in God, where there is a real walking in the paths of wickedneſs. Let not the gliſter of the world render thee faint and languid in a courſe of Piety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The keeping our ſtation. Do good.</hi> Becauſe wicked men flouriſh, hide not thy ſelf therefore in a corner, but keep thy ſphere, run thy Race. <hi>And verily thou ſhalt be fed;</hi> have every thing needful for thee. And now, becauſe men delight in that wherein they truſt, the Pſalmiſt diverts us from all other objects of delight, to God as the true object. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord;</hi> place all thy pleaſure and joy in him. And becauſe the motive expreſſeth the anſwer of prayer, the duty enjoyned ſeems to reſpect the act of prayer, as well as the object of prayer; Prayer coming from a delight in God, and a delight in ſeeking him. Truſt is both the ſpring of joy and the ſpring of Supplication. When we truſt him for ſuſtenance and preſervation, we ſhall receive them; ſo when we delight in ſeeking him, we ſhall be anſwered by him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41445:30"/>1. <hi>The Duty.</hi> In the act, <hi>Delight.</hi> In the object, <hi>the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The motive. He ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart,</hi> the moſt ſubſtantial deſires, thoſe deſires which he approves of; The deſire of thy heart as gracious, though not the deſire of thy heart as carnal: The deſire of thy heart as a Chriſtian, though not the deſire of thy heart as a creature. <hi>He</hi> ſhall give; God is the object of our joy, and the author of our comfort.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Delight in God, in ſeeking him only, procures gracious anſwers; <hi>or,</hi> without chearful prayers, we cannot have gracious anſwers.</q>
            <p>There are two parts. 1. Chearfulneſs on our parts. 2. Grants on Gods part.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chearfulneſs and delight on our parts. Joy is the tuning the Soul. The command to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce precedes the command to pray, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>Rejoyce evermore, pray without ceaſing.</hi> Delight makes the melody, prayer elſe will be but a harſh ſound. God accepts the heart only, when it is a gift given, not forc'd. Delight is the marrow of Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Dulneſs is not ſuitable to the great things we are chiefly to beg for.</hi> Goſpel-diſcoveries are a feaſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. Dulneſs becomes not ſuch a ſolemnity. Manna muſt not be ſought for with a dumpiſh heart. With joy we are to draw water out of the Wells of Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. Faith is the bucket, but joy and love are the hands that move it. They are the <hi>Hur</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that hold up the hands of this <hi>Moſes.</hi> God doth not value that mans ſervice, who accounts not his ſervice a priviledge and a pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Dulneſs is not ſuitable to the Duty.</hi> Goſpel-duties are to be performed with a Goſpel-temper. God's People ought to be a willing people, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a people of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As though in prayer no other faculty of the Soul had its exerciſe but the will. This muſt breathe fully in every word; as the ſpirit in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s wheels. Delight, like the Angel<note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 13.20.</note>, muſt aſcend in the ſmoke and flame of the Soul. Though there be a kind of union by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, yet the real union is by affection. A man cannot be ſaid to be a ſpiritual King, if he doth not preſent his performances with a Royal and Prince-like ſpirit. 'Tis for vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wreſtling that <hi>Jacob</hi> is called a Prince, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28.</p>
            <p>This Temper is eſſential to grace. Natural men are deſcribed to be of a heavy and weary temper in the offering of Sacrifices, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. It was but a ſickly, lame Lamb they brought for an offering, and yet weary of it, that which was not fit for their table they thought fit for the Altar.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What this delight is.</hi> Delight properly is an affection of the mind that Springs from the poſſeſſion of a good which hath been ardently deſired. This is the top ſtone, the higheſt ſtep, delight is but an <hi>Embryo</hi> till it come to fruition, and that certain and immutable; Otherwiſe, if there be probability or poſſibility of loſing that which we have preſent poſſeſſion of, the fear of it is as a drop of gall that infects the ſweetneſs of this paſſion; delight properly is a ſilencing of deſire, and the banquet of the Soul on the preſence of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired object.</p>
            <p>But there is a delight of a lower ſtamp.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In deſires.</hi> There is a delight in deſire, as well as in fruition. A chearfulneſs in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as well as in attainment. The deſire of <hi>Canaan</hi> made the good <hi>Iſraelites</hi> chearful in the wilderneſs. There is an inchoate delight in motion, but a conſummate delight in reſt and fruition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In hopes.</hi> Deſired happineſs affects the Soul; much more expected happineſs, Rom. 5.2. <hi>We rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> Joy is the natural iſſue of a well grounded hope. A tottering expectation will engender but a tottering delight: Such a delight will Mad-men have, which is rather to be pitied than deſired. But if an imaginary hope can affect the heart with ſome real joy, much more a hope ſetled upon a ſure bottom, and raiſed upon a good foundation There may be joy in a title as well as in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In contemplation.</hi> The conſideration and ſerious thoughts of heaven do affect a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, and fill it with pleaſure, tho it ſelf be as if in a wilderneſs. The near appproach to a deſired good doth much affect the heart. <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſurely more pleaſed with the ſight of <hi>Canaan</hi> from <hi>Piſgah,</hi> than with the hopes of it in the deſert A travellers delight is more raiſed when he is neareſt his journeys end, and a hungry ſtomach hath a greater joy when he ſees the meat approaching which muſt ſatisfy the appetite. As the Union with the object is nearer, ſo the delight is ſtronger. Now this delight the Soul hath in duty, is not a delight of fruition, but of deſire, hope, or contemplation; <hi>Gaudium viae,</hi> not <hi>patriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We may conſider delight as <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Active,</hi> which is an act of our Souls in our approaches to God. When the heart like the Sun rouzeth up itſelf as a Gyant to run a ſpiritual race.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41445:31"/>2. <hi>Paſſive.</hi> Which is Gods diſpenſation in approaches to us, and often met with in our chearful addreſſes to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoiceth and works righteouſneſs.</hi> When we delightfully claſp about the Throne of grace, God doth often caſt his arms about our necks: Eſpecially when chearful prayer is accompanyed with a chearful obedience. This joy is, when Chriſt meets us in prayer with a <hi>be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven,</hi> thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt granted. The active delight is the health of the Soul, the paſſive is the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Soul. The one is mans duty, the other Gods peculiar gift. The one is the inſeparable property of the new birth, the other a ſeparable priviledge. There may be a joy in God, when there is little joy from God. <hi>There may be Gold in the Mine, when no flowers on the ſurface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may conſider delight as ſetled or tranſient: As Spiritual or Senſitive.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſetled delight.</hi> In ſtrong and grown Chriſtians, when prayer proceeds out of a thankfulneſs to God, a judicious knowledg and apprehenſion of God. The nearer to God the more delight: As the motion of a ſtone is moſt ſpeedy when neareſt its Center.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Senſitive delight.</hi> As in perſons troubled in mind, there may be a kind of delight in prayer, becauſe there is ſome ſenſe of eaſe in the very venting itſelf; And in ſome, becauſe of the novelty of a duty they were not accuſtom'd to before. Many prayers may be put up by perſons in neceſſity without any Spiritual delight in them; As crazy perſons take more Phyſick than thoſe that are healthful, and obſerve the Spring and Fall, yet they delight not in that Phyſick. The Phariſee could pray longer, and perhaps with ſome delight too, but upon a ſenſual ground, with a proud and a vaunting kind of chearfulneſs, a delight in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; When the Publican had a more ſpiritual delight; Though a humble ſorrow, in the conſideration of his own vileneſs, yet a delight in the conſideration of Gods mercy. This ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive delight may be more ſenſible in a young, than in a grown Chriſtian. There is a more ſenſible affection at the firſt meeting of friends, though more ſolid after ſome converſe; As there is a love which is called the <hi>love of</hi> the <hi>eſpouſals.</hi> As it is in ſorrow for ſin, ſo in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; A young convert hath a greater torrent, a grown Chriſtian a more conſtant ſtream; As at the firſt converſion of a ſinner there is an overflowing joy among the Angels, which we read not of after, though without queſtion there is a ſettled joy in them at the growth of a Chriſtian. An elder ſon may have a delight in his Fathers preſence more rooted, firm and rational, than a younger child that clings more about him with affectionate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. As ſincerity is the Soul of all graces and duties, ſo this delight is the luſtre and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydery of them.</p>
            <p>Now this Delight in Prayer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis an inward and hearty delight.</hi> As to the ſubject of it, it is ſeated in the heart. A man in prayer may have a chearful countenance and a drowſy ſpirit. The Spirit of God dwells in the heart, and love and joy are the firſt-fruits of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Love to duty, and joy in it; joy as a grace, not as a meer comfort. As God is hearty in offering mercy, ſo is the Soul in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning for it. There is a harmony between God and the heart. Where there is delight, there is great pains taken with the heart; a gracious heart ſtrikes it ſelf again and again; As <hi>Moſes</hi> did the rock twice. Thoſe ends which God hath in giving, are a Chriſtians ends in asking. Now the more of our hearts in the requeſts, the more of Gods heart in the grants. The Emphaſis of mercy is <hi>Gods whole heart</hi> and <hi>whole Soul</hi> in it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.41. So the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of duty is our whole Heart and whole Soul. As without Gods chearful anſwering, a gracious Soul would not relliſh a mercy, ſo without our hearty asking God doth not relliſh our prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis a delight in God who is the Object of Prayer.</hi> The glory of God, communion with him, enjoyment of him is the great end of a believer in his Supplications. That delight which is in prayer, is chiefly in it as a means conducing to ſuch an end, and is but a ſpark of that delight which the Soul hath in the object of prayer. God is the Center wherein the Soul reſts, and the end which the Soul aims at. According to our apprehenſions of God are our deſires, for him, when we apprehend him as the chiefeſt good, we ſhall deſire him, and delight in him, as the chiefeſt good. There muſt firſt be a delight in God, before there can be a ſpiritual delight, or a permanency in duty, <hi>Job</hi> 27.10. <hi>Will he delight himſelf in the Almighty? will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways call upon God?</hi> Delight is a grace; and as faith, deſire, and love, have God for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo hath this. And according to the ſtrength of our delight in the object or end, is the ſtrength of our delight in the means of attainment. When we delight in God as glorious, we ſhall delight to honour him, when we regard him as good, we ſhall delight to purſue and enjoy him, and delight in that which brings us to an intercourſe with him. He that rejoyces in God, will rejoyce in every approach to him. <hi>The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength, Neh.</hi> 8.10. The more joy in God, the more ſtrength to come to him. The want of this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Snail-like motion to him. Men have no ſweet thoughts of God, and therefore no mind to converſe with him. We cannot judg our delight in prayer to be right, if we have not a delight in God; for natural men may have a delight in prayer, when they have corrupt and ſelfiſh ends; they may have a delight in a duty, as it is a means, according to their apprehenſions, to gain ſuch an end: As <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Balak</hi> offered their Sacrifice chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, hoping to ingratiate themſelves with God, and to have liberty to curſe his people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A delight in the precepts and promiſes of God, which are the ground and rules of Prayer.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:41445:31"/> Firſt <hi>David</hi> delights in Gods teſtimonies, and then calls upon him with his whole heart. A gracious heart muſt firſt delight in precepts and promiſes, before it can turn them into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; For prayer is nothing elſe but a preſenting God with his own promiſe, deſiring to work that in us, and for us, which he hath promiſed to us. None was more chearful in prayer than <hi>David,</hi> becauſe none was more rejoycing in the ſtatutes of God. Gods ſtatutes were his <hi>Songs, Pſa.</hi> 119.54. And the divine Word was ſweeter to him than the hony and hony-comb. If our hearts leap not at divine promiſes, we are like to have but drowſy Souls in deſiring them. If our eye be not upon the dainties God ſets before us, our deſires cannot be ſtrong for him. If we have no delight in the great charters of heaven, the rich legacies of God, how can we ſue for them? If we delight not in the covenant of grace, we ſhall not delight in prayers for grace. It was the hopes of reward made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo valiant in ſuffering, and the joy ſet before Chriſt in a promiſe, made him ſo chearful in enduring the ſhame. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A delight in prayer itſelf.</hi> A Chriſtians heart is in ſecret raviſht into heaven. There is a delight in coming near God, and warming the ſoul by the fire of his love. The Angels are chearful in the act of praiſe, their work is their glory. A holy Soul doth ſo delight in this duty, that if there were no command to engage him, no promiſe to encourage him, he would be ſtepping into Gods Courts. He thinks it not a good day, that paſſeth without ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with God. <hi>David</hi> would have taken up his lodgings in the Courts of <hi>God,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards it as the only bleſſedneſs, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 65.4. And ſo great a delight he had in being in Gods preſence, that he envies the birds the happineſs of building their neſts near his Tabernacle. A delight there is in the holineſs of Prayer; a natural man under ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles may delight in Gods comforting and eaſing preſence, but not in his ſanctifying preſence. He may delight to pray to God as a ſtorehouſe to ſupply his wants, but not as a refiners fire to purge away his droſs. Prayer, as Praiſe, is a melody to God in the heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. And the Soul loves to be fingering the inſtrument and touching the ſtrings.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>A delight in the things askt.</hi> This heavenly chearfulneſs is moſt in heavenly things. What delight others have in asking worldly goods, that a gracious heart hath in begging the light of Gods countenance. That ſoul cannot be dull in prayer, that ſeriouſly conſiders he prays for no leſs than heaven and happineſs; no leſs than the glory of the great God. A gracious man is never weary of ſpiritual things, as men are never weary of the Sun, but though it is enjoyed every day, yet long for the riſing of it again. From this delight in the matter of prayer it is, that the Saints have redoubled and repeated their Petitions, and often double the <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of Prayer, to manifeſt the great affections to thoſe things they have askt. The Soul loves to think of thoſe things the heart is ſet upon; and frequent thoughts expreſs a delight.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>A delight in thoſe graces and affections which are Exerciſed in Prayer.</hi> A gracious heart is moſt delighted with that prayer wherein grace hath been more ſtirring, and gracious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections have been boyling over. The Soul deſires not only to ſpeak to God, but to make melody to God; the heart is the inſtrument, but graces are the ſtrings, and prayer the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and therefore he is more diſpleaſed with the flagging of his graces than with miſſing an anſwer. There may be a delight in gifts, in a mans own gifts, in the gifts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the pomp and varniſh of devotion; But a delight in exerciſing ſpiritual graces is an ingredient in this true delight. The Phariſees are markt by Chriſt to make <hi>long prayers,</hi> vaunting in an outward bravery of words, as if they were playing the Courtiers with God, and complementing him: But the Publican had a ſhort prayer, but more grace; <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner;</hi> There is relyance and humility; A gracious heart labours to bring fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming affections, and if he cannot bring flaming grace, he will bring ſmoaking grace: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the preparation of his heart as well as the anſwer of his prayer, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whence this delight ſprings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Spirit of God.</hi> Not a ſpark of fire upon our own hearth, that is able to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this Spiritual delight; 'Tis the holy Ghoſt that breaths ſuch an heavenly heat into our affections. The Spirit is the fire that kindles the Soul, the ſpring that moves the watch, the wind that drives the ſhip. The ſwifteſt ſhip with ſpread ſails will be but ſluggiſh in its motion, unleſs the wind fills its ſails; without this Spirit we are but in a weak and ſickly condition, our breath, but ſhort, a heavy and troubleſome Aſthma is upon us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3. When I cryed unto thee, thou didſt <hi>ſtrengthen me with ſtrength in my Soul.</hi> As prayer is the work of the Spirit in the heart, ſo doth delight in prayer owe itſelf to the ſame author. God will make them joyful in his houſe of prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From grace.</hi> The Spirit kindles, but gives us the Oyl of grace to make the lamp burn clear. There muſt not only be wind to drive, but ſails to catch it; a prayer without grace is a a prayer without wings. There muſt be <hi>grace to begin it.</hi> A dead man cannot rejoice in his Land, Money or Food, he cannot act, and therefore cannot be chearful in action: Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuppoſeth life: dead men cannot perform a duty, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.17. <hi>the dead praiſe not the Lord,</hi>) nor dead ſouls a chearful duty. There muſt not only be grace infuſed, but <hi>grace actuated.</hi> No man in a ſleep or ſwoon, can rejoice. There muſt not only be a living princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but a lively operation. If the ſap lurk only in the root, the branches can bring forth no fruit; our beſt prayers without the ſap of grace diffuſing itſelf, will be but as withered bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Grace actuated puts heat into performances, without which they are but benum'd and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41445:32"/> frozen<note n="*" place="margin">Reynolds.</note>. Ruſty grace, as a ruſty Key, will not unlock, will not enlarge the heart. There muſt be <hi>grace to maintain it.</hi> There is not only need of fire to kindle the lamp, but of Oyl to preſerve the flame; natural men may have their affections kindled in a way of common working, but they will preſently faint and dye, as the flame of cotton will dimm and vaniſh, if there be no Oyl to nouriſh it. There is a temporary joy in hearing the word; and if in one duty, why not in another? why not in prayer? <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. Like a fire of thorns that makes a great blaze, but a ſhort ſtay.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From a good Conſcience.</hi> A good heart is a continual feaſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15. He that hath a good conſcience muſt needs be chearful in his religious and civil duties. Guilt will come trembling, and with a ſad countenance into the preſence of Gods Majeſty. A guilty child cannot with chearfulneſs come into a diſpleaſed fathers preſence. A Soul ſmoakt with Hell cannot with delight approach to heaven. Guilty Souls in regard of the injury they have done to God, will be afraid to come; and in regard of the ſoot of Sin wherewith they are defiled, and the blackneſs they have contracted, they will be aſhamed to come. They know that by their ſins they ſhould provoke his anger, not allure his love. A Soul under conſcience of ſin cannot look up to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. Nor will God with favour look down upon it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.2. It muſt be a pure heart that muſt ſee him with pleaſure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. And pure hands muſt be lifted up to him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Jonah</hi> was aſleep after his ſin, and was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript in quickneſs to pray, even by Idolaters. The marriners jogg him, but could not get him, that we read of, to call upon that God whom he had offended, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. Where there is corruption, the ſparks of ſin will kindle that tinder, and weaken a Spiritual delight. A <hi>perfect heart</hi> and a <hi>willing mind</hi> are put together, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.2. There cannot be willingneſs without ſincerity, nor ſincerity without willingneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>From a holy and frequent familiarity with God.</hi> Where there is a great familiarity, there is a great delight; delight in one anothers company, and delight in one anothers converſe; ſtrangeneſs contracts, and familiarity dilates the Soul. There is more alacrity in going to a God with whom we are acquainted, than to a God to whom we are ſtrangers. This doth encourage the Soul to go to God; I go to a God whoſe face I have ſeen, whoſe goodneſs I have taſted, with whom I have often met in prayer. Frequent familiarity makes us more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the excellency of another; an excellency apprehended will be beloved, and being beloved will be delighted in.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>From hopes of ſpeeding.</hi> There is an expectative delight which ariſeth from hopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rejoycing in hope.</hi> There cannot be a pleaſant motion, where there is a palſie of doubts. How full of delight muſt that Soul be, that can plead a promiſe, and carry God's hand and ſeal to Heaven, and ſhew him his own Bond; when it can be pleaded not only as a favour to engage his mercy, but in ſome ſenſe a debt to engage his truth and righteouſneſs! Chriſt in his prayer, which was his Swan-like ſong, <hi>John</hi> 17. pleads the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between his Father and himſelf; <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, glorifie me with that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I had with thee before the world was.</hi> This is the caſe of a delightful approach, when we carry a Covenant of grace with us for our ſelves, and a promiſe of ſecurity and perpetuity for the Church. Upon this account we have more cauſe of a pleaſant motion to God, than the ancient Believers had. Fear acted them under the Law, Love us under the Goſpel. He cannot but delight in prayer, that hath Arguments of God's own framing to plead with God, who cannot deny his own Arguments and Reaſonings. Little comfort can be ſuckt from a <hi>perhaps.</hi> But when we come to ſeek Covenant-mercies, God's faithfulneſs to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant puts the mercy paſt a perhaps. We come to a God ſitting upon a Throne of Grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> not on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> to a God that deſires our preſence, more than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>From a ſenſe of former mercies and acceptation.</hi> If Manna be rained down, it doth not only take off our thoughts from <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Garlick, but quickens our deſires for a ſecond ſhower. A ſenſe of God's Majeſty will make us loſe our gariſhneſs; and a ſenſe of God's Love will make us loſe our dumpiſhneſs. We may as well come again with a merry heart, when God accepts our prayers, as go away and eat our bread with joy when God accepts our works, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. The Doves will readily fly to the windows, where they have formerly found ſhelter; and the Beggar to the door where he hath often received an Alms. <hi>Becauſe he hath inclined his ear to hear me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live, Pſal.</hi> 116.2. I have found refuge with God before; I have found my wants ſupplied, my ſoul raiſed, my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations check'd, my doubts anſwered, and my prayers accepted, therefore I will repeat my Addreſſes with chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>I might add alſo other Cauſes; as a love to God, a heavenlineſs of ſpirit, a conſideration of Chriſt's Interceſſion, a deep humiliation. The more unpleaſant ſin is to our relliſh, the more delightful will God be, and the more chearful our Souls in Addreſſes to him. The more unpleaſant ſin is to us, the more ſpiritual our Souls are; and the more ſpiritual our Souls, the more ſpiritual our Affections: The more ſtony, the more lumpiſh and unapt for motion; the more contrite, the more agil. From a ſpiritual taſt; report of a thing may contribute ſome pleaſure, but a taſt greater.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reaſons. <hi>Without chearful ſeeking we cannot have a gracious Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God will not give an anſwer to thoſe prayers that diſhonour him</hi> A flat and dumpiſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41445:32"/> is not for his honour. The Heathens themſelves thought their gods ſhould not be put off with a Sacrifice dragg'd to the Altar. We read of no Lead, that lumpiſh earthly metal, imployed about the Tabernacle or Temple, but the purer and moſt gliſtering ſorts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. God will have the moſt excellent Service, becauſe he is the moſt excellent Being. He will have the moſt delightful Service, becauſe he beſtows the moſt delightful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts. All Sacrifices were to be offered up with fire, which is the quickeſt, and moſt active Element. 'Tis a diſhonour to ſo great, ſo glorious a Majeſty, to put him off with ſuch low and dead-hearted Services. Thoſe Petitions cannot expect an anſwer, which are offered, in a manner injurious to the perſon we addreſs to. 'Tis not for the credit of our great Maſter, to have his Servants dejected in his work: As though his Service were an uncomfortable thing; as though God were a Wilderneſs, and the World a Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Dull and lumpiſh Prayer doth not reach him, and therefore cannot expect an anſwer.</hi> Such deſires are as Arrows that ſink down at our feet; there is no force to carry them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The heart is as an unbent Bow, that hath no ſtrength. When God will hear, he makes firſt a prepared heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. He firſt ſtrings the Inſtrument, and then receives the ſound. An <hi>enlarged heart</hi> only <hi>runs, Pſal.</hi> 119.32. A contracted heart moves ſlowly, and often faints in the Journey.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Lumpiſhneſs ſpeaks an unwillingneſs that God ſhould hear us.</hi> It ſpeaks a kind of a fear that God ſhould grant our Petitions. He that puts up a Petition to a Prince coldly and dully, gives him good reaſon to think, that he doth not care for an anſwer. That Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no great mind to a Harveſt, that is lazy in tilling his ground, and ſowing his ſeed. How can we think God ſhould delight to read over our Petitions, when we take ſo little delight in preſenting them? God gives not mercy to an unwilling perſon. The firſt thing God doth, is to make his People willing. Dull ſpirits ſeek God as if they did not care for finding him: Such tempers either account not God real, or their Petitions unneceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Without delight we are not fit to receive a mercy.</hi> Delight in a mercy wanted, makes room for deſire; and large deſires make room for mercy. If no delight in begging, there will be no delight in enjoying. If there be no chearfulneſs to quicken our prayers when we need a bleſſing, there will be little joy to quicken our praiſe when we receive a bleſſing. A weak, ſickly ſtomack is not fit to be ſeated at a plentiful table. Where there is a dull asking ſupply, there is none, or a very dull ſenſe of wants. Now God will not ſend his mercies but to a Soul that will welcome them. The deeper the ſenſe of our wants, the higher the eſtimation of our Supplies. A chearful Soul is fit to receive the leaſt, and fit to receive the greateſt mercy. He will more prize a little mercy than a dull petitioner ſhall prize a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe he hath a ſenſe of his wants. Had not <hi>Zacheus</hi> had a great joy at the news of Chriſts coming by his door, he had not ſo readily entertained and welcomed him.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a great pleaſure in the ways of God, if rightly underſtood.</hi> Prayer, which is a duty wherein we expreſs our wants, is delightful. There is more ſweetneſs in a Chriſtians asking than in a wicked mans enjoying bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What delight will there be in heaven!</hi> If there be ſuch ſweetneſs in deſire, what will there be in full fruition! There is joy in ſeeking, what is there then in finding! Duty hath its ſweets, its thouſands, but glory its ten thouſands. If the pleaſure of the ſeed-time be ſo great, what will the pleaſure of the harveſt be!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The miſerable condition of thoſe that can delight in any thing but prayer.</hi> 'Tis an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our enmity to God, when we can ſin chearfully, and pray dully: When duty is more lothſome than iniquity.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Of Examination.</hi> We pray, but how are our hearts? If it be for what concerns our momentary being, is not our running like the running of <hi>Ahimaaz?</hi> But when for Spiritual things, do not our hearts ſink within us, like <hi>Nabals?</hi> Let us therefore follow our hearts cloſe, ſuffer them not to give us the ſlip in our examination of them, reſolve not to take the firſt anſwer, but ſearch to the bottom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether we delight at all in prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How do we prize the opportunities of duty?</hi> There is an opportunity of an earthly, and an opportunity of a heavenly gain; conſider which our hearts more readily cloſe with. Can we with much pleaſure follow a vain world, and heartleſly welcom an opportunity of duty, delight more with <hi>Judas</hi> in baggs, than in Chriſts company? This is ſad. But are praying op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities our feſtival times? Do we go to the houſe of God with the voice of joy &amp; praiſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether we ſtudy excuſes to wave a preſent duty, when conſcience and opportunity urge and invite us to it?</hi> Are our Souls more skillful in delaies than in performances? Are there no excuſes when ſin calls us, and ſtudyed put-offs when God invites us? Like the ſluggard, folding our arms, yet a little while longer? Or do our hearts riſe and beat quick againſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous excuſes that ſtep in to hinder us from prayer?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How are our hearts affected in prayer?</hi> Are we more ready to pray our ſelves aſleep, than into a vigorous frame? Do we enter into it with ſome life, and find our hearts quickly tire and jade us? Are we more awake when we are up, than we were all the time upon our knees? are our hearts in prayer like withered, ſapleſs things, and very quick afterwards, if any worldly buſineſs invite us? Are we like logs and blocks in prayer, and like a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41445:33"/> Roe upon the mountains in earthly concerns? Surely what our pulſe beats quickeſt to, is the object moſt delighted in.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>What time is it we chooſe for Prayer?</hi> Is it not our drowzieſt, lazyeſt time, when our nods are as many, or more than our petitions; as though the dulleſt time and the deadeſt frame were moſt ſutable to a living God? Do we come with our hearts full of the world to pray for heaven? Or do we pick out the moſt lively ſeaſons? <hi>Luther</hi> choſe thoſe hours for prayer and meditation, wherein he found himſelf moſt lively for ſtudy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Do we not often wiſh a duty over?</hi> As thoſe in the Prophet that were glad when the Sabbath was over, that they might run to their buying and ſelling? Or, are we of <hi>Peter</hi>'s temper, and expreſs <hi>Peter</hi>'s Language, <hi>'Tis good to be here</hi> with Chriſt on the Mount?</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Do we prepare our ſelves by delightful and enlivening conſiderations?</hi> Do we think of the Precept of God, which ſhould ſpur us, and of the Promiſe of God, which ſhould allure us? Do we rub our Souls to heat them? Do we blow them to kindle them into a flame? Do we ſend up Ejaculations for a quickening ſpirit? If thoughts of God be a burden, requeſts to him will not be a pleaſure. If we have a coldneſs in our thoughts of God and Duty, we can have no warmth in our deſire, no delight in our Petitions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Do we content our ſelves with dull motions, or do we give check to them?</hi> Can we, though our hearts be never ſo lazy, ſtroke our ſelves at the end, and call our ſelves good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants? Do we take our Souls to task afterwards, and examine why they are ſo lazy, why ſo heavy? Do we enquire into the cauſes of our deadneſs? A gracious Soul is more troubled at its dulneſs in prayer, than a natural conſcience is at the omiſſion of prayer. He will complain of his ſluggiſhneſs, and mend his pace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we find we have a delight, let us examine <hi>whether it be a delight of the right kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do we delight in it, becauſe of the gifts we have our ſelves, or the gifts of others we joyn with?</hi> A man may rejoyce in hearing the Word, not becauſe of the holineſs and ſpirituality of the matter, but becauſe of the goodneſs of the dreſs, and the elegancy of the expreſſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. The Prophet was unto them as a lovely Song, as one that had a pleaſant voice. He may upon the ſame ground delight in prayer. But this is a temper not kindled by the true fire of the Sanctuary. Or, do we delight in it, not when our Tongues are moſt quick, but our hearts moſt warm; not becauſe we have the beſt words, but the moſt ſpiritualiz'd affections? We may have Angels gifts in prayer, without an Angels ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Is there a delight in all parts of a duty?</hi> Not only in asking temporal bleſſings, or ſome ſpiritual, as pardoning mercy, but in begging for refining grace? Are we earneſt only when we have boſom quarrels, and conſcience-convulſions, but flag when we come to pray for ſanctifying mercy? The riſe of this is a diſplicency with the trouble and danger, not with the ſin and cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Doth our delight in prayer, and ſpiritual things out do our delight in outward things?</hi> The Pſalmiſts joy in God was more than his delight in the Harveſt or Vintage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.4. Are we like Ravens that delight to hover in the Air ſometimes, but our greateſt delight is to feed upon Carrion? Though we have, and may have a ſenſible delight in worldly things, yet is it as ſolid and rational, as that we have in duty?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Is our delight in Prayer an humble delight?</hi> Is it a rejoycing with humbling? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſs, and rejoyce before him with trembling.</hi> If our ſervice be right, it will be chearful; and if truly chearful, it will be humble.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Is our delight in Prayer accompanied with a delight in waiting?</hi> Do we, like Merchants, not only delight in the firſt lanching of a Ship, or the ſetting it out of the Haven with a full fraught, but alſo in expectations of a rich return of ſpiritual mercies? Do we delight to pray, though God for the preſent doth not delight to give, and wait like <hi>David</hi> with an owning God's Wiſdom in delaying? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.6. Or do we ſhoot them only as Arrows at random, and never look after them where they light, or where to find them?</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Is our delight in praiſing God when mercy comes, anſwerable to the delight in praying, when a wanted mercy was begged?</hi> The ten Lepers deſired mercy with an equal chearfulneſs, in hopes of having their Leproſie cured; but his delight that returned, only was genuine. As he prayed with a loud voice, ſo he praiſed with a loud voice, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.13, 15. And Chriſt tells him, his faith had made him whole. As he had an anſwer in a way of grace, ſo he had before, a gracious delight in his asking; the others had a natural delight, and ſo a return in a way of common providence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Uſe, <hi>Of Exhortation. Let us delight in Prayer.</hi> God loves a chearful giver in Alms, and a chearful petitioner in Prayer. God would have his children free with him. He takes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of a ſpiritual frame, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Who hath engaged his heart?</hi> The more delight we have in God, the more delight he will have in us. He takes no pleaſure in a lumpiſh Service. 'Tis an uncomely ſight to ſee a joyful Sinner, and a dumpiſh Petitioner. Why ſhould we not exerciſe as much joy in holy duties, as formerly we did in ſinful practices? How delightfully will men ſit at their games, and ſpend their days in gluttony and luxury? And ſhall not a Chriſtian find much more delight in applying himſelf to God? We ſhould delight that we can, and have hearts to ask ſuch gifts, that thouſands in the world never dream of begging. To be dull, is a diſcontentedneſs with our own Petitions. Delight in prayer is the way to gain aſſurance. To ſeek God, and treat him as our chiefeſt good, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41445:33"/> the Soul to him. Delighting in Acceſſes to him, will enflame our love. And there is no greater ſign of an intereſt in him, than a prevalent eſtimation of him. God caſts off none that affectionately claſp about his Throne.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Pray for quickening grace.</hi> How often do we find <hi>David</hi> upon his knees for it? God only gives this grace, and God only ſtirs this grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Meditate on the Promiſes you intend to plead.</hi> Unbelief is the great root of all dumpiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was by the belief of the Word we had life at firſt, and by an exerciſe of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief we gain livelineſs. What maintains our love, will maintain our delight; the amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and the excellency of the Promiſes, are the incentives and fuel both of the one and of the other. Think that they are eternal things you are to pray for, and that you have as much invitation to beg them, and as good a promiſe to attain them as <hi>David, Paul,</hi> or any other ever had. How would this awaken our drowzy Souls, and elevate our heavy hearts, and open the lazy eye-lids to look up! And whatever meditation we find begin to kindle our Souls, let us follow it on, that the ſpark may not go out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chuſe the time when your hearts are moſt revived.</hi> Obſerve when God ſends an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hoiſt up the ſails when the wind begins to blow. There is no Chriſtian but hath one time or another a greater activeneſs of ſpirit. Chuſe none of thoſe ſeaſons which may quench the heat, and dull the ſpritelineſs of your affections. Reſolve before hand this, To <hi>delight</hi> your ſelves <hi>in the Lord, and</hi> thereby you ſhall gain <hi>the deſire of</hi> your <hi>hearts.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>How quick are Gods creatures to obey his call for the puniſhment of a rebellious people?</hi> He calls thoſe <hi>ſix men,</hi> and they preſently appear ready to execute Gods pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God doth not bring judgments on a people, till their wickedneſs hath overgrown the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Children.</hi> Six to deſtroy, But one to preſerve. a Sixfold work of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one of preſervation, intimating that there were ſix bad to one good in the City.</p>

            <p>v. 3. <hi>And the glory of the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>was gone up from the</hi> Cherub <hi>whereupon he was, to the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the houſe]</hi> The glory of God, which was in the Propitiatory above the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> went from one <hi>Cherub</hi> to another, till it came to the threſhold; as birds that are leaving their neſts leap from one branch to another till they fly quite away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. <hi>God is not fixed to any one place.</hi> He hath his temple among his people, diſcovers himſelf in his Ordinances, but upon provocations departs. The glory of God, and his Ordinances, are not entayled upon any nation longer than they walk worthy of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The glory of Gods Ordinances is obſcured among a people, before judgments come upon them.</hi> The <hi>glory of God went up from the</hi> Cherub. <hi>I will take away the hedge of my vineyard, and it ſhall be eaten up, and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be troden down, Iſa.</hi> 5.5. The Ordinances of God are underſtood by ſome interpreters to be the hedge, and wall of a People; when God takes away the Hedge, the breach is made wide for every wild beaſt to enter, and tread it down. The preſence of God in his Ordinances, the preſence of God in his providences is the hedge of a people. The <hi>Temple</hi> is forſaken by God, and then polluted, in judgment, by men, <hi>v.</hi> 7.

            <p>The bloud of Chriſt upon the conſcience is the beſt mark of diſtinction, as the blood of the paſchal Lamb upon the poſts was the mark whereby the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were diſcerned from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the edge of the Angels deſtroying ſword diverted from them. It was a mark of a ſpecial providence of God. The deſtroying Judgments were to follow the Sealing Angel, and not touch thoſe that were markt by him on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Obſerve 1. <hi>All judgments have their commiſſions from God, whom to touch, whom to overthrow.</hi> God doth not ſtrike at random. The man in the linnen garment was to bridle the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> &amp; direct their Swords to the right objects. God overpowers the natural inclinations of all his creatures, whom he appoints executioners. God hath a hook in the noſtrils of <hi>Leviathan;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done without the leave of providence; man forms the weapons, God gives the edge, and directs the ſtroak.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the higheſt fury and vengeance God hath reſerves of mercy for his own people.</hi> Angels are appointed to be preſervers of his children in the midſt of the deſtroying of a people. Inviſible Angels are joyned with viſible enemies, to conduct and govern their motions according to the Command of their great General. God's Judgments are diſpenſed with greater kindneſs to his People, than deſires to take vengeance upon his Enemies. He hath a heart of Mercy as well as a hand of Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God is more careful of his people than revengefull againſt his enemies.</hi> He firſt orders the ſealing of the mourners, before he orders the deſtruction of the rebells; he will firſt honour his mercy in the protection of the one, before he will glorifie his juſtice in the deſtruction of the other. The Angel hath orders to ſecure <hi>Lot</hi> before <hi>Sodom</hi> was fired. The execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his wrath were to march after the ſecuring Angel, not before him; Nor equal with him: And were only to cut off thoſe whom the Angel had paſſed by.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41445:35"/>4. If you take this mark for a mark on the Conſcience, then obſerve, <hi>That Serenity of Conſcience is a gift of God to his people in the time of ſevere judgments.</hi> As when death is near, the Conſcience of a good man is moſt ſerene, and ſings ſweetly in his breaſt the notes of his own integrity. In judgments as well as in death God ſets Conſcience upon its pleaſant notes. But this mark is not properly meant here; the Conſcience is a mark to our ſelves, but this is a mark to the executioners.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The places where God hath manifeſted the glory of his Ordinances, are the ſubjects of his greateſt judgments upon their provocations. Go through the City, through</hi> Jeruſalem: That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have manifeſted my glory, which I have intruſted with my oracles, which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in the midſt of enemies, like a ſpark in the midſt of many waters. Go thorow that City into the midſt of it, and let not your eye ſpare.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The greateſt fury of God in a time of judgment often lights upon the Sanctuary,</hi> v. 6. <hi>Begin at the Sanctuary, defile the houſe.</hi> Not a man of them eſcaped as <hi>Oecalampad.</hi> notes, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I was left:</hi> He ſaw not in the viſion what was done in the City, but he was left alone in the Temple.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a Duty.</hi> If we are by the <hi>Praeſcript</hi> of God to bewail in confeſſion, the ſins of our Forefathers, committed before our being in the world, certainly much more are we to lament the ſins of the Age wherein we live, as well as our own, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. <hi>If they ſhall confeſs their iniquity, and the iniquity of their Fathers.

               <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovers it to be a duty, when he reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for being puft up, inſtead of mourning for that <hi>fornication</hi> which had been committed by one of their profeſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. And when he writes of ſome that made the glorious Goſpel ſubſervient to their own <hi>bellies,</hi> he mixes his tears with his Ink, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>I tell you weeping, they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> The Primitive Chriſtians did much bewail the lapſes of their fellows. <hi>Celerinus,</hi> among the Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> acquaints <hi>Lucian</hi> of his great grief for the Apoſtacy of a Woman, through fear of perſecution, which afflicted him ſo, that in the time of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the time of their joy in that Age, he wept night and day, and was reſolved that no delight ſhould enter into his heart, till through the mercy of Chriſt ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to the Church. And we find <hi>the Witneſſes clothed in Sackcloth,</hi> when they propheſied in a ſinful time, to ſhew their grief for the publick abominations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Satan</hi> can be no pleaſure to a Chriſtian, and muſt therefore be a torment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It was our Saviours practice.</hi> As he had the higheſt love to God, ſo he muſt needs have the greateſt grief for his diſhonour. <hi>He ſighed in his ſpirit</hi> for the incredulity of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when they askt a <hi>ſign,</hi> after ſo many had been preſented to their Eyes, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.12. <hi>He ſighed deeply in his ſpirit.</hi> And the hardneſs of their hearts at another time raiſed his <hi>grief,</hi> as well as his indignation, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. He was ſenſible of the leaſt diſhonour of his Father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69 9. <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.</hi> I took them to heart. Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf when his Father was injured; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſcants upon it, when he applies it to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3. His Soul was more pierc'd with the wrongs done to God, than the reproaches which were directed againſt his own perſon. His grief was unexpreſſibly greater than can be in any creature, becauſe of the unimitable ardency of his love to God, the nearneſs of his relation to him, and the unſpotted purity of his Soul. Chriſt had a <hi>double</hi> relation; to <hi>Man,</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> His compaſſion to men afflicted him with groans and tears at their bodily diſtempers; his affection to his Father would make him grieve as much to ſee him diſhonoured, as his love to man made him groan to ſee man afflicted. This grief for ſin was one part of Chriſt's Sacrifice and Suffering; for he came to make a full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God by enduring his wrath, to the holineſs of God by offering up an infinite ſorrow for ſin, which it was impoſſible for a creature to do. We cannot ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſhould only accept the puniſhment, but not bewail the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which was the cauſe of it. A Sacrifice for the ſins of others, without remorſe for thoſe ſins, had not been acceptable; it had not been agreeable to the purity of his humane Nature. He wept at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s obſtinacy, as well as for her miſery, and that in the time of his triumph. The loud <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> could not ſilence his grief, and ſtop the expreſſions of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. It was like a ſhower when the Sun ſhined. If Chriſt as our Head was filled with inward ſorrow for mens diſpleaſing the holineſs of God, 'tis ſurely our duty as his Members, to imitate the afflictions of the Head. He is unworthy of the name of Chriſt, who is not afflicted as Chriſt was; nor can call Chriſt his Maſter, who doth not imitate his graces, as well as pretend to believe his Doctrine; he cannot ſee that God who hath diſtinguiſht him from the world, diſhonoured, his precepts contemned, but he muſt have his Soul overcaſt with a gloomy cloud. 'Tis our glory to value the things he eſteem'd, to deſpiſe the things he contemn'd, to rejoyce in that wherein he was delighted, and to grieve for that which was the matter of his ſorrow and indignation. Thus was he afflicted, though he had a joy in the aſſurance of his Fathers favour, and the aſſiſtance of his Fathers power. The higheſt aſſurance of God's love in particular to us, ought not to hinder the impreſſions of grief for the diſhonour of his name. Did Chriſt ever look upon the ſwiniſh world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out melting into pity? Did he bleed for the ſins of the world, and ſhall not we mourn for them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Angels, as far as they are capable, have their grief for the ſins of men.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors often bring in the Angels weeping for ſin<note n="*" place="margin">

And one tells us, that in an Ancient <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi> Book he finds an Anſwer of God to <hi>Moſes;</hi> Even about this Throne of mine there ſtand thoſe, and they are many, that ſhed tears for the ſins of men. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41445:36"/> us, they rejoyce at the repentance of men, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. Their Lord is glorified by a return of a Subject: The Subject advantaged by caſting down his arms at the feet of his Lord. They do therefore as far as they are capable, mourn for the revolts of men, <hi>ſuo modo,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place. They can ſcarce rejoyce at mens repentance without having a contrary affection for mens prophaneneſs; if they are glad at mens return, becauſe God is thereby glorified, it cannot be conceived but they mourn for, and are angry with their ſins, becauſe God is thereby ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Unconcernedneſs at the diſhonour of God cannot conſiſt with their ſhining knowledge and burning love. They cannot behold a God ſo holy, ſo glorious, ſo worthy to be beloved, without having ſome regret for the neglects and abuſes of him by the Sons of men. How can they be inſtruments of Gods Juſtice, if they are without anger againſt the deſervers of it?</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>'Tis an acceptable duty to God.</hi> Since it is an imitating the copy of our Saviour, it is acceptable to God, nothing can pleaſe him more than to ſee his Creatutes tread in the ſteps of his Son.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a fulfilling the whole law,</hi> which conſiſts of love to God and love to our neighbours: 'tis ſet down as a Character of Charity both as it reſpects God and man, <hi>Not to rejoyce in iniquity,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. i. e. to be mightily troubled at it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Tis a high Teſtomony of Love to God.</hi> The Nature of true Love is to wiſh all good to them we love, to rejoyce when any good we wiſh doth arrive unto them, to mourn when any evil afflicts them, and that with a reſpect to the beloved object. <gap reason="foreign">

Where there is this love, there is a rejoycing at one anothers happineſs, a grieving at one anothers misfortunes. If it be a part of love to rejoyce at that whereby God is glorified, 'tis no leſs a part of love to mourn for that whereby God is vilified. So ſtrait is the union of affection between God and a righteous Soul, that their bleſſings and injuries, joys and ſorrows are twiſted together. The increaſe of Gods glory is the greateſt good that can happen to a Soul ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of him; his diſhonour then is the greateſt miſery. A gracious Soul is like <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> content to decreaſe, that Chriſt might encreaſe, in the eſteem of men. He is like <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that would rather have the Crown upon <hi>Davids</hi> head than his own, as the words intimate, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17. <hi>v. thou ſhalt be King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I ſhall be next unto thee:</hi> And grieved more for his Fathers diſpleaſure againſt <hi>David</hi> than againſt himſelf. So doth a Chriſtian grieve more for the wrongs of God, than for thoſe in his own liberty, eſtate, or life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> was more careful of the name of God, than of the ſafety of the people ſingly conſidered, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.9. <hi>What wilt thou do unto thy great name?</hi> The glory of God is not dear to that man, that can without any regret look upon his beſpattered name. What affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath he to his friend, who can ſee him torn in pieces by Dogs, and ſtand unconcerned at his calamity? God indeed is uncapable of ſuffering; but what rending is to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is ſin to the Divine Majeſty. Can that man be ſaid to love God who hath no reflection when he ſees others tumbling God from his Throne, and ſetting up the Devil in his ſtead? Who can hear the tremendous name of God belcht out by polluted lips upon every vile occaſion, and made the ſport of Stage and Stews, without any inward reſentment?</p>
            <p>He only eſteems God as his King who cannot ſee his laws broken without remorſe. How Loyally did <hi>Moſes</hi> his affection to God work, when he heard the name of God blaſphemed, and ſaw a <hi>calf</hi> uſurp the adoration due to the God of Heaven? And <hi>David</hi> felt the ſtroak of that ſword in his own bowels which was directed againſt the heart of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.20, 21, 22. The dearer Gods name is to any, the more affected they are that God and Chriſt are loved and honoured leſs than they deſire they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard ſometimes to diſcern this Love to God, when Gods intereſt and ours are joyned, when we would mask our diſpleaſure againſt ſome mens offences with a care of Gods honour, which is nothing but a hatred of the Perſon ſinning, or revenge againſt him for ſome conceived injury to us. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> calling for <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> upon the <hi>Samaritans</hi> when they refuſed Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.53, 54, 55. might ſeem to be a generous concern for their maſters honour, but Chriſt knew it proceeded much from that natural enmity which the <hi>Jews</hi> bore to the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> The beſt way to judg is, when the intereſt is purely Gods, and hath no fuel of our own diſcontents to boil up, either grief or anger. Such an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot but be highly acceptable to God, who is affected with the love of the creature, and honours them that honour him, as well as deſpiſes thoſe that lightly concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Love to our Neighbours.</hi> Nothing can evidence our love to man more, than a ſorrowful reflection upon that wickedneſs which is the ruine of his Soul, the diſturbance of humane ſociety, and unlocks the treaſures of Gods judgments to fall upon mankind. <hi>Sin is a reproach to a people, Prov.</hi> 14.34. 'Tis always an act of Charity to mourn for the reproaches and ruine of a people. 'Tis a groſs enmity to others, to ſee them ſtab themſelves to the heart, jeſt with eternal flames, wiſh their damnation at every word, run merrily to the bottomleſs gulf, and all this without beſtowing a ſigh upon them, and pitying their madneſs; the greater ſhould be our grief, by how much the further they are from any for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. If <hi>Cain</hi> diſcovered both his enmity to God, and alſo to his brother, in grieving that his brothers works were ſo good, <hi>Abel</hi> muſts needs in the practice of the contrary duty,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41445:36"/> manifeſt his love to <hi>Cain</hi> in grieving that his works were ſo bad. Our Saviours tears for the <hi>Jews</hi> diſcovered no leſs a concern for their miſery than for Gods diſhonour. Anger for ſin may have ſomething of revenge in it: Grief for ſin diſcovers an affection both to God and the ſinner. A duty which reſpects at once the ſubſtance of <hi>both</hi> the <hi>tables</hi> cannot but be pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis an imitating return for Gods affection.</hi> How doth God reſent the injuries done to his people as much as thoſe done to himſelf? Thoſe ſins that immediately ſtrike at his glory are not accompanied with ſuch quick judgments, as thoſe that grate upon his Servants. Sharp perſecutions that tear the people of God in pieces have fuller vials of judgments here, than Vollies of others ſins which rend the name of God. When <hi>Cain</hi> affronted God by his Sacrifice, God comes not to a reckoning with him, till he had added the murther of his Brother to his former crimes againſt his maker. A ſweeter and more thankful return, and a more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate imitation of God there cannot be, than to reſent the injuries done to God more than thoſe done to our ſelves. The pinching of his people doth moſt pierce his heart; a ſtab to his honour, in gratitude, ſhould moſt pierce theirs. The <hi>four Kings</hi> that came againſt <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 14.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſped well enough in their invaſion, gained the victory and had been in a fair way to have enjoyed the ſpoil, had they not laid their hands upon <hi>Lot,</hi> which was the occaſion of their diſgorging their prey. As God ingaged himſelf in the recovery of <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo <hi>Lot</hi> concerned himſelf in the honour of God; Gods anger is ſtirred at the Captivity of <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> vexation is awakened at the injuries againſt God. What troubles his Children, raiſes ſenſible compaſſion in him to the ſufferer, and revenge upon the perſecutor; whatſoever doth blaſpheme the name of God, doth at the ſame time rack a ſincere heart. A perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor cannot injure a believer, but Chriſt records it as a wrong done to himſelf; and Chriſt cannot be diſhonoured by men, but a righteous Soul doubles his grief. Here is a mutual return of affection and aeſtimation, which is highly pleaſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This temper juſtifies Gods Law and his juſtice</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>David</hi>'s grief being for mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Law teſtified his choice va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of it.</note>. When we diſlike and diſapprove of others ſins as well as our own, we acknowledg the glory of the law, that it is juſt, holy, and good, and ſet our ſeal of approbation to it. It juſtifies the holineſs of the law in prohibiting ſin the righteouſneſs of the law in condemning ſin. It owns the ſoveraignty of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and the juſtice of God in puniſhing. The law requires two things; obedience to it, and ſuffering for the tranſgreſſion of it. This frame of heart approves of the obedience the law requires of men as rational creatures, and juſtifies the ſufferings the law inflicts upon men as impenitent ſinners. Unleſs we mourn for the ſins of others and thereby ſhew our diſtaſt, we cannot give God the glory of his Judgments which he ſends upon a people. This diſowning of ſin is very acceptable to God, becauſe by it Men honour that law for whoſe violations they are ſo troubled, and own Gods right of impoſing a law upon his creatures, and the creatures vileneſs in diſgracing that Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis a ſign of ſuch a temper God hath evidenced himſelf in ſcripture much affected with.</hi> 'Tis a ſign of a heart of fleſh, the nobleſt work of God in the creature. A ſign of a contrite heart, the beſt ſacrifice that can ſmoak upon his Altar next to that of his Son. This he will not deſpiſe, becauſe it is a beam of glory dropped down from him, and aſcending in a <hi>ſweet ſavour</hi> to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. Without this, we cannot have a ſufficient evidence that we are truly broken-hearted. We may mourn for our own ſins for ſecret by-ends, becauſe they are againſt our worldly Intereſts, and have reproaches treading upon the heels of them; we may mourn for the ſins of our friends, out of a natural compaſſion to them, and as they are the progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of ſome approaching miſery to them; but in ſorrowing for the ſins of the world, we have not ſo many, and ſo affecting obligations to divert us from a ſound aim in our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. To be affected with the diſhonour of God by the ſins of others, is a diſtinguiſhing character of a ſpiritual conſtitution from a natural tenderneſs. 'Tis both our duty, and God's pleaſure. No grief is ſweeter to God, nor more becoming us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>'Tis a means of preſervation from publick Judgments. Noah</hi> did not preach righteouſneſs without a ſenſible reflection on that unrighteouſneſs he preached againſt; and he of all the world had the ſecurity of an Ark for him and his Family, when all the reſt ſtruggled for life, and ſunk in the waters. No meer man ever wore more black for the Funeral of God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than <hi>David,</hi> nor was any bleſſed with more gracious deliverances. The more zeal we have for God (which is an affection made up of grief and anger) the more protection we have from him<note n="*" place="margin">

If there be any ground of hope, it will ſhine forth when we are in ſuch a poſture. There might be others in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had not complied with the Idolatry of that Age; but none exempted from the ſtroke of the <hi>Six</hi> Deſtroyers, but thoſe whoſe mouths lay in the duſt, and whoſe cries againſt the common ſin aſcended to Heaven; only the mourners among the good men are marked by the Angel for indemnity from the publick puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sincerity always eſcapes beſt in common Judgments, and this temper of mourning for publick ſins, is the greateſt note of it.</hi> This is the greateſt note of ſincerity. We read of an <hi>Ahab,</hi> who put on Sackcloth for his own ſin, and humbled himſelf before the Lord; of a <hi>Judas</hi> ſorrowing that he betrayed his Maſter: Self-intereſt might broach their tears, and force out
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41445:37"/> their ſorrow; but never an <hi>Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or any other ungodly perſon in Scripture, lamented the ſins of others. Nay, they were all eminent for holineſs, that were noted for this frame, whom we have mentioned before. <hi>Moſes,</hi> a non-ſuch for ſpeaking with God face to face. <hi>David,</hi> who only had that honourable title of a man after God's own heart. <hi>Iſay,</hi> who had the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt proſpect of Evangelical glory, of all the Prophets. <hi>Ezra,</hi> a reſtorer of his Country. <hi>Daniel,</hi> a man greatly beloved: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Redeemer of the world; and <hi>Paul,</hi> the only Apoſtle rap't up in the third Heaven, he was alſo humbled for the <hi>ſins of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Ezra</hi> hath a mighty Character, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.10. <hi>He prepared his heart to ſeek the Law of the Lord; and to do it, and to teach in</hi> Iſrael <hi>Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And he both mourned for, and prayed againſt the common ſin. <hi>Lot</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for this without a glorious Epithete: The Spirit of God over-looks thoſe ſins of his mentioned in Scripture, and ſpeaks not of him by his ſingle name, but <hi>Juſt Lot,</hi> his <hi>righteous Soul,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. A ſincere Righteouſneſs glittered in his vexation for the wronged In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of God. What a mark of honour doth the Holy-Ghoſt ſet upon this temper! 'Tis not drunken <hi>Lot,</hi> or inceſtuous <hi>Lot,</hi> with which ſins he is taxed in Scripture. This publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious ſpirit covered thoſe temporary ſpots in his Scutcheon. When all other ſigns of Righteouſneſs may have their exceptions, this temper is the utmoſt term, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go beyond in our ſelf-examination. The utmoſt proſpect <hi>David</hi> had of his ſincerity, when he was upon a diligent enquiry after it, was his anger and grief for the ſin of others; when he had reached ſo far, he was at a ſtand, and knew not what more to add, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Am I not grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies. Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> If there be any thing that better can evidence my ſincerity, than this, Lord acquaint me with it; <hi>know my heart, i. e.</hi> make me to know it. He whoſe ſorrow is only for matter confin'd within his own breaſt, or ſtreams of it in his life, has reaſon many times to queſtion the truth of it. But when a man cannot behold ſin as ſin in another, without ſenſible regret, 'tis a ſign he hath ſavingly felt the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of it in his own Soul. 'Tis a high pitch and growth, and a conſent between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and the Soul of a Chriſtian, when he can lament thoſe ſins in others whereby the Spirit is grieved, when he can rejoyce with the Spirit rejoycing, and mourn with the Spirit mourning. This is a clear teſtimony that we have not ſelf-ends in the ſervice of God, that we take not up Religion to ſerve a turn, that God is our aim, and Chriſt our beloved. Now <hi>upright</hi> perſons have ſpecial promiſes for protection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.18, 19. <hi>The Lord knows the way of the upright, they ſhall not be aſhamed in an evil time;</hi> they ſhall not be aſhamed <hi>in</hi> it, though they may be daſht <hi>by</hi> it; they ſhall have a bleſſed inward ſecurity, though they may not always have an outward, when the wicked ſhall conſume away as the fat of Lambs, and exhale in the ſmoke. God's Eyes are upon them in the worſt of ſtraits. If ever he ſhew himſelf ſtrong, 'tis for thoſe that are <hi>perfect in heart</hi> before him. This is the end of the rouling and running of his <hi>Eyes about the Earth,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. To ſuch he is both a <hi>Sun,</hi> and a <hi>Shield,</hi> a Sun to comfort them, and a Shield to defend them that <hi>walk uprightly, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. There may be an uprightneſs in the heart, when there is an unknown, or a negligent crookedneſs in ſome particular path; and when men are negligent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving others for ſuch ſins as open the clouds of Judgments, God may be a Sun to ſuch, to give them ſome comfort in a common calamity, but ſcarce a Shield to defend them from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This frame clears us from the guilt of common ſins.</hi> He that is not afflicted with them, contracts a guilt of thoſe inſolencies againſt God by a tacit approbation, or not hindering the torrent by his prayers, tears, endeavours. Sin is not to be viewed without horror: we ſhare in the guilt, if we manifeſt not our deteſtation of the practice. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had not approved themſelves clear in the matter of the inceſtuous perſon till they had mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid he ſhould be charged by God as a murtherer and thief, as well as <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> if he did not profeſs his loathing of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6. <hi>Oh my Soul come not thou into their ſecrets, unto their aſſembly mine honour be not thou united; for in their anger they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew a man, and in their ſelf-will they digged down a wall.</hi> His Soul ſhould bear a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt their ſecrets; he would count it his diſhonour to give their ſin any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance before God or man. <hi>David</hi> intimates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. that if he did not hate the works of thoſe that turn aſide, the guilt of them would cleave to him. If we can patiently bear the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour of God, without marks of our diſpleaſure, we ſhall be reckoned in the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as one lump with the greateſt ſinners. He that is not with Chriſt, is againſt him; he that is not on the ſide of God by a holy grief, is on the ſide of ſin by a ſilent conſent. A thorow diſtaſt of ſins upon the account of their abomination to God, frees us from the guilt of them in the ſight of God. To mourn for them, and pray againſt them, is a ſign we would have prevented them if it had lain in our power; and where we have contributed to them, we by thoſe acts revoke the crime. When we cannot be Reformers, all that we can do is to turn mourners, and in our places admoniſhers and reprovers, and God is righteous, not to charge the guilt where it is not contracted or revoked. But where any are infected with common ſins, they muſt expect to taſt of ſome common Judgments<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lightfoot, Olian.</hi> on Exod. 6.13.</note>. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did partake of ſome of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſins; and though God was upon their deliverance, yet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41445:37"/> he inflicted upon them ſome of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Plagues; the Plague of Lice, which was the firſt God brought, without being imitated by the <hi>Magicians,</hi> was common upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as well as the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> for God did not ſever <hi>Goſhen</hi> from <hi>Aegypt</hi> till the Plague of <hi>Flies, Exod.</hi> 8.12, 23. <hi>In that day will I ſever the Land of</hi> Goſhen; <hi>I will put a diviſion between my people and thy people.</hi> And therefore in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reckoning thoſe <hi>Plagues,</hi> never mentions the <hi>Lice,</hi> becauſe that was inflicted upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> as well as <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This is a way to keep the Soul from common infection. 'Tis difficult for a Soul to defile it ſelf with the ſins of the times, when tears are continually running down the eyes for them. 'Tis an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſin, &amp; againſt the Plague which follows at the heels of it. If we look not upon them with grief, we are in danger to be ſnar'd in the ſame temptation. Beſides, not ſorrowing for them is an implicit conſent to them, and by conſenting to them, we are little better than actors in them. By grieving for them, we enter our diſſent, &amp; paſs our vote againſt them. When any ſin becomes national, it is imputed to the body of the Nation; as in ſome tranſgreſſions of the Law, the whole body of the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was involved; and there is no way for any particular perſon to remove the guilt from him, but by diſowning it before God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A grief for common ſins, is an endeavour to repair the honour God has loſt.</hi> 'Tis a paying to God that by Repentance (as much as lies in a creature) which is due from the worſt ſinner, himſelf; 'tis to keep up ſome of God's glory, when ſo much is trodden down. And when the grief is accompanied with a more exact obedience, it repairs the honour God hath loſt by the miſcarriage of others. 'Tis an endeavour to wipe off the ſtains from the Robe of the glory of God. And thoſe that bear up God's glory in the world, ſhall find, if need be, the Creative, Omnipotent Power of God ſtretched out for their defence, in as eminent a manner as the cloud by day, which preſerved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the ſcorching of the Sun, or the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire by night, which prevented their wandring into by-ways and Precipices; for <hi>upon all the glory ſhall be a defence, Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> upon thoſe that bear the mark of his glorious Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bear up his honour among the Sons of men. When we concern our ſelves for God's honour, God will concern himſelf for our protection. God never was, nor ever will be behind-hand with his creature in affection. <hi>Moſes</hi> was zealous for God's glory againſt the golden Calf, and God concern'd himſelf for his honour againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam. Numb.</hi> 12. and then againſt the tumults of the People.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The mourners in</hi> Sion <hi>are humble, and humility is preventive of Judgments.</hi> To lie flat upon the ground, is a means to avoid the ſtroke of a Cannon-bullet. <hi>When men are caſt down, he ſhall ſave the humble perſon, Job</hi> 22.29. They lie loweſt in the duſt before God, who concern themſelves not only with the weight of their own ſins, but with that of others. Pride is a preparation for Judgment; the higher the Tower aſpires, the fitter Tinder it is for lightning; the bigger any thing ſwells, the nearer it is to burſting; the prouder any man is, the plainer Butt he is for an Arrow of God's wrath. Pride lifts up it ſelf againſt God's Laws and Soveraignty, as much as this frame of ſpirit acknowledges, and ſubmits to him. It was a temper contrary to this cauſed God to ſend Worms to banquet upon <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.23. <hi>He gave not God the glory.</hi> He was not afflicted with the ſin of the People, nor reproved them for aſcribing to him the honour of God. A Soul-affliction for common ſins is a bar to Judgments. God <hi>revives the ſpirit of the humble, Iſa.</hi> 57.15. They that ſhare in the griefs of the Spirit, ſhall not want the comforts of the Spirit. God is concern'd in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by virtue of his promiſe, not to neglect thoſe whom he hath promiſed to revive. He dwells with the contrite ſpirit; who more contrite than he that grieves for publick ſins, and Family ſins, and City ſins, as well as his own private? Men do not uſe to fire their own houſes, much leſs God the houſe and heart, which is dearer to him than either firſt or ſecond Temple, or local Heaven it ſelf. I might add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. That ſuch <hi>keep Covenant with God.</hi> The Contract runs on God's part, to be an <hi>Enemy to his Peoples Enemies, Exod.</hi> 23.22. It muſt run on our parts, to love that which God loves, hate that which God hates, grieve for that which grieves and diſhonours him; Who can do this by an unconcernedneſs? Thoſe that keep Covenant with God ſhall not fail of one tittle of it on God's part. 7. Such alſo <hi>fear Gods Judgments,</hi> and fear is a good means to prevent them. The Old World feared not God's threatning of the Deluge, and that came, and ſwallowed them up. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> feared not God's Judgments, and that haſtened the deſtroying Shower. The Advice of the Angel upon the approach of Judgments, is to <hi>fear God, and give glory to him, Rev.</hi> 14.7. And then follows another, <hi>v.</hi> 8. with the news of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> fall; <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> The fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is the preſervation of his People.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. <hi>Reproof</hi> for us. Where is the man that hangs his harp upon the willows at the time the Temple of God is prophaned? A head, a Fountain of tears for Common ſins, is a commodity rare to be found even in hearts otherwiſe gracious. The Mourners have been for number but a few, like the gleanings of the Vintage; but the Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> for multitude, like the weeds in fallow ground. What multitudes of thoſe that diſparage God, and trample upon his Soveraign Commands, rend in pieces the very Law of Nature as well as the rights of Religion? It were well if there were one to <hi>Six,</hi> as was intimated in the beginning there might be in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but we have reaſon to fear that one marker for the ſecret mourners would be too much for an hundred deſtroyers. I do not queſtion but there are ſome that ſigh for the abominations they ſee,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41445:38"/> and hear of, &amp; that becauſe they are diſhonourable to God as well as injurious to themſelves. But who of us preſent here can ſay, we have been deeply enough, and graciouſly enough affected with them? Certainly both you and I may bring a charge againſt our ſelves before the throne of God for this neglect, that we have not been throwly humbled for, &amp; frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewailed publick iniquities, and ſpread them before God in ſecret. If we are unconcern'd in common ſins, can we imagine God will leave us unconcern'd in common Judgments? If we endeavour not to keep up the glory of God, he will extract glory to himſelf out of our aſhes. If this frame be ſo little regarded among profeſſors, what ſhall we ſay to many others that have as little remorſe for the ſtabs of Gods honour, as they would have for the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of an <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Prince, nay for the death of ſome inconſiderable fly? that have reſentments for wrongs done to themſelves, and ſorrow at Command for any worldly loſs, but not one ſpark of regret for affronts offered to God? In this cauſe their hearts are as dry as a heath in a parching Summer. Who laments the tearing the name of God in pieces by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable oaths? Who bewails the impudent uncleanneſs boaſted of by Concubines in the face of the Sun? Who mourns for ſo many thouſand foreheads bearing the mark of the beaſt, and ſo many thouſands more preparing to receive it? It reproves then</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that make a mock and ſport of ſin,</hi> ſo far they are from mourning for it. The wiſe man gives them the title of <hi>fools, Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>fools make a mock at ſin.</hi> Which though it ſeems too low a Character for ſuch abominable works, yet in ſcripture it hath a greater import than in our Common diſcourſe, it ſignifies an <hi>Atheiſt, Pſal.</hi> 14.1. Prodigious mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! to make that our ſport which is the diſhonour of God, the murderer of Chriſt, the grief of the Spirit, and the deſtruction of the Soul; that which opens the flood-gates of wrath, and brings famines, plagues, wars upon a people! If mourning for others ſins be an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like that of <hi>Angels,</hi> delighting in other ſins is an affection like that of <hi>Devils.</hi> He is at the greateſt diſtance from Chriſt, that looks pleaſantly upon that which Chriſt could not regard without grief and anger. God ſeems to ſeal up ſuch to deſtruction as well as the mourners to preſervation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12, 13. <hi>And in that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping and mourning, to baldneſs and girding with Sackcloth, and behold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen and killing Sheep, eating fleſh and drinking wine, let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hoſts, ſurely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till you dye;</hi> they were ranters inſtead of mourners, and God paſſes this ſentence on them, <hi>their iniquity ſhall not be purged from them till they dye.</hi> If we carry our ſelves jollily at the ſins of others, we evidence that the concerns of God are of little concern to us, that we have ſlight thoughts of his glory, and caſt it at the heels of our own paſſions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe that make others ſins the matter of invectives, rather than of lamentations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter the man without bewailing the ſin.</hi> We ſhould conſider common ſins with affection to God, and pity to the offenders; with a deſire that they may reſtore, by a true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the glory they have robb'd God of by an accurſed Rebellion. While we hate the ſin, we ſhould evidence that we love the man<note n="*" place="margin">Non nunquam fae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note>. We muſt never love the wickedneſs, nor hate the perſon. We pity a ſick man, though we loath his Diſeaſe. Sinners are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough without our hatred, and by hating them we make our ſelves more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by committing a fault againſt reaſon and nature, and do them no good. The more wicked any man is, the more worthy of pity, by how much the more his crime is our hatred. God, who is infinite purity, hates mens ſins, becauſe they are enemies to his holineſs; but he hath a common affection to their perſons, as they are the effects of his goodneſs and creative Power. Our <hi>exclamations</hi> againſt common ſins ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>lamentations</hi> for them. There ought to be more grief in our hearts, than fire in our tongues. They break the whole Law, that lament not the crime out of love to the Law-maker, and grieve not for the Sinner out of love to their neighbour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thoſe who are imitators of common ſins, inſtead of being mourners for them.</hi> As though others did not pilfer God's right faſt enough, and were too ſlow in pulling him from his Throne; as if they grieved that others had got the ſtart of them in wickedneſs. 'Tis a pious ſadneſs, and a bleſſed grief to be affected with common ſins, without being fetter'd by them; to mourn for them, without cleaving to them; to be tranſported with ſorrow for them, without being drawn by a love to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Thoſe that fret againſt God, inſtead of fretting againſt their own fooliſhneſs, Prov.</hi> 19.3. The ſins of good men are many times provocations to God to draw up the ſluce from the hearts of wicked men, and give liberty to their luſts, for the chaſtening of others; and therefore in grieving for the ſins of others, they implicitly grieve for their own.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Thoſe who are more tranſported againſt others ſins, as they are, or may be occaſions of hurt to them, than as they are injuries to God.</hi> How warm are we often in our own Cauſe, and how cold in God's? We partly ſatisfie our own diſcontent by ſuch a carriage, but not our duty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Thoſe who are ſo far from mourning for common Sins, that they never truly mournd for their own.</hi> Who have yet the <hi>Treaſures of wickedneſs,</hi> after the rod of God hath been upon them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſs in the houſe of the wicked</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Rod they had felt? Common ſins are but a Glaſs wherein we may ſee our common Nature. The beſt men have the worſt Sins in their Nature, though by Grace they have them not in their Practice. He that grieves not for other Mens Sins, more or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41445:38"/> leſs, never grieved truly for his own. He that is not concerned for the diſhonours of God by others, is little concerned for the diſhonour of God by himſelf. Let us uſe our Eyes for thoſe ends for which God hath given them; they are inſtruments of ſight, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary for us to mourn for our own ſins. We can never mourn for others Sins, unleſs we mourn for our own. If we ſorrow not for our own, the ſorrow we may pretend to have for others, proceeds not from a right cauſe. We have that one Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> in our Nature, which ſubjected the whole world to an <hi>Anathema.</hi> Let us not ſtay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; every Man will lay the fault upon Sin in the bulk, without reflecting on the ſin in his own Bowels. We can complain particularly of thoſe ſins that are common, and why ſhould we reſt in generals, when we come to our own? <hi>Dolus verſatur in univerſalibus,</hi> 'tis a deceitful ſorrow that is for Sin in a heap. Is there not perfidiouſneſs to God, coldneſs in his ways, too much ſlighting the Goſpel, want of bowels and compaſſion, incorrigibleneſs under judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, houſes fir'd and pride not conſumed; falſeneſs in reſolutions, like Oxen moving with the touch of the Goad, and preſently ſtanding ſtill; <hi>deceitful bows,</hi> letting the ſtring ſlip after they have ſtood fully bent? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.4. There may be Sins among us that may cauſe a ſtorm that we little think of: The Mariners little ſuſpected <hi>Jonah</hi> to be the cauſe of the tempeſt till he diſcovered it himſelf. He that never mourned for his own Sins, cannot perform this duty ſo neceſſary for his preſervation, and therefore cannot expect the mark of God in a time of publick judgment. He that would rightly mourn for the Corruptions of others, muſt enquire whether he hath not the ſame in his own Bowels, and fling the hardeſt ſtone at them. <hi>Judah</hi> calls for <hi>Tamar</hi> to the flames for that crime which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been a partner and actor in; ſo apt are we to be ſevere againſt others Sins, and indulgent to our own. The beſt have need to mourn for their own ſins in relation to the publick: The only good man in the Ship was <hi>Jonah,</hi> and for his ſin was the Storm ſent, and the reſt like to be wrackt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Uſe. Of <hi>Comfort to ſuch as mourn for Common Sins.</hi> All the carnal world hath not ſuch a writ of protection to ſhew in the whole ſtrength of Nature, as the meaneſt <hi>mourner in</hi> Sion hath in his ſighs and tears. Chriſts mark is above all the Shields of the earth, and thoſe that are ſtampt with it, have his wiſdom to guard them againſt folly, his power againſt weakneſs, the everlaſting Father againſt man, whoſe breat his in his Noſtrils. We ſee that God doth not ſtrike at random, but reſerves a ſweetneſs for his Servants in the midſt of his fury againſt his Enemies; he hath his Meſſengers to mark, as well as his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners to ſtrike; the iſſuing the reſolute orders of his Fury, hinders not thoſe of his Grace and Compaſſion to his own. He will have a care of his Balſom-trees that diſtil this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquor, no leſs than he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their ſharpeſt wars to have a care of the <hi>fruitful trees of a Land, Deut,</hi> 20.19. God in the 6. <hi>v.</hi> following the Text gives the like charge to the executioners of his judgments, as <hi>David</hi> did to the Army concerning <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.5. <hi>Deal gently with the young man,</hi> Ezek. 9.6. <hi>Come not near any Man upon whom is the mark.</hi> He makes proviſion firſt for the ſecurity of thoſe, before he unſheaths his Sword againſt his Enemies. The Deluge flows not from heaven till <hi>Noah</hi> be caſed in the Ark, nor is <hi>Sodom</hi> on Fire till <hi>Lot</hi> be lodged in the Mountain. God will always have a Church in the world, and ſuffer a generation of his own to inhabit the Earth: Gods attributes ſhall not interfere one with another; his truth remains firm notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the provocations of Men. When thoſe people were ripe for judgments, God had his mourners among the Idolaters which he marks for preſervation; when he had threatened great judgments, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.30, 31. the turning the Sun into Darkneſs and the Moon into Blood, he promiſes a remnant in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Sion, v.</hi> 32. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be delivered, for in mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be deliverance as the Lord hath ſaid, and in the remnant whom the Lord ſhall call.</hi> Neither the fury of Men ſhall, nor the judgments of God will extinguiſh the Church; not the malice of Men, becauſe of Gods power, nor God himſelf, becauſe of his truth; <hi>[The Lord hath ſaid.]</hi> God will either preſerve under judgments, or take away in them, to a place of happineſs. 'Tis thought by ſome, that the reaſon <hi>Enoch</hi> was ſnatcht to Heaven in the midſt of his life, according to the rate of living in that age, was becauſe he was afflicted with the ſins of thoſe among whom he lived. And indeed he could ſcarce walk with God without grieving that others diſdained to walk with him, and acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him: God would take him from that affliction, as well as from the danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted by the age. He will either have his <hi>Chambers</hi> wherein to hide them here <hi>till the indignation be over-paſt, Iſa.</hi> 26.20, 21. or his Manſions to lodge them in for ever with himſelf. What hurt is it to any to be refuſed a hiding place here, that he may be conducted to the poſſeſſion of a glorious reſidence for ever? That judgment that takes off the Fetters of a wicked Man for execution, knocks off the Fetters of the godly for a Gaol delivery; like Fire it conſumes the Droſs, and refines the Gold. The day of Gods wrath is <hi>a day of gloomineſs to the wicked, Joel.</hi> 2.2. but as the morning ſpread upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the godly mourners, the dawning of comfort to them. God out of the ſame Pillar of the cloud diffuſed light upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſhot thunders and lightenings upon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> to which perhaps the Prophet might here allude.</p>

A flood of grief becomes us in a flood of ſin. How well would it be, if we were as loud in crying for mercy, as our ſins at the preſent are in crying for vengeance? While judgments march to ſeize our perſons, our grief ſhould run to damp the judgments: Moiſt Walls choak the Bullet. 'Tis far better to mourn for the cauſe of judgments, than to mourn under them. The jolly blades were the firſt prey to the Enemy, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, to <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>They that chaunt to the ſound of the Viol, and drink wine in Bowls ſhall go captive with the firſt that go captive.</hi> We of this City have moſt reaſon to mourn; the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a Nation is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> uſually of ſin, and the faireſt mark for the Arrows of Gods indignation. The chief City of a Nation is uſually threatned in Scripture, <hi>Rabbah</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites, Damaſcus</hi> of <hi>Syria, Tyrus</hi> of <hi>Phoenicia, Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Empire, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſuitably, why not <hi>London</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> And let no Man think that mourning is a degenerate and effeminate diſpoſition: Doth <hi>Solomon</hi> ever imprint the ſame Character on mourning as he doth on laughter? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2. Doth he ever vilifie that with a term of madneſs, and call the mourners <hi>Bedlams?</hi> How can any, who hath not put off the Title and Nature of Man, behold, without amazement and grief, Men ſo bold, as to pull down the judgments of God upon them, and force his indignation? This temper is a pious embalming Chriſts crucified honour; ſhall any Man that profeſſeth Chriſt have ſo little love to him, as not to beſtow a groan upon him, when he ſees him freſhly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and abuſed? If we had not committed any ſin in our whole life, there is cauſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the abominations of the world. Chriſt had an unſpotted innocence and an unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grief for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſins and miſery; <hi>Oh</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, <hi>how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Men may pretend a grief for the ſins of the times, when it is only for themſelves, that they have not thoſe pleaſing opportunities of greatning themſelves, and that eſtimation in the world, that ſtage for Pride and Covetouſneſs to act upon which they deſire. Our mourning is then right, when we grieve not ſo much that we, as that God is a ſufferer. It ſhould be proportionable where there are great breaches of Gods Law; our grief ſhould be as full, as, if poſſible, to fill up the ditch that is digg'd; the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> implies it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> tore their garments, (a ſign of a great grief and indignation) when the <hi>Heathens would have ſacrificed to them as Gods, Acts</hi> 14.13. they uſed not the ſame expreſſions in ſmaller ſins; but this was againſt the Nature of God, and a multitude engaged in it. The greater the ſin, the greater the ſorrow. I need not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſins among us; the impudent Atheiſm, contempt of the Goſpel, putrifying Luſt, barefac'd Pride, rending Diviſions, many ſins viſible enough to be grieved for, and too many to be ſpoken of. The ſorrow ſhould be univerſal. Not for one ſin which may be againſt any Mans particular intereſt, but for all, even thoſe that our carnal advantage is not concerned in. God is diſhonoured by one as well as by another, and Chriſt is crucified by one as well as by another. It muſt be attended with a more ſtrict obedience: 'Tis the higheſt generoſity to wear Chriſts Livery, when others put it off and lay it aſide as uſeleſs. No doubt but <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> mourned as well as the reſt for the ſufferings of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but he teſtified alſo an Heroick affection to him, in going boldly to <hi>Pilate</hi> to beg the body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for an honourable burial, when none of the other diſciples ſought after it, but truſted more to the ſwiftneſs of their heels for their own ſecurity, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd themſelves for the honour of their Maſter. While others therefore are defiling the world with their abominations, let us be waſhing it with our Tears, and filling hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with our cries, that when God marcheth in his fury, we may be ſecure by his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our humiliations.</p>
            <p>Motives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This is a means to have great tokens of the love of God.</hi> No queſtion but Chriſt in his agony bewailed the ſins of the world, and then was an Angel ſent to comfort him, and aſſure him of an happy iſſue. It was juſt after the teſtimony of his diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for diſſwading him from that death, whereby he was to honour God, and waſh off the ſtain of ſin, and repair the violations of the Law, whereby he manifeſted a concern for his fathers honour, that he was transfigured, and had therein the earneſt of an heavenly glory, and that tranſporting voice: <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear you him, Mat.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a means to prevent judgments.</hi> Tears cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt, are a good means to quench that juſtice which is a conſuming Fire. Sin puts a ſtop to the working of Gods Bowels, and opens the Magazines of wrath: grief for it diſarms Gods hand of his Thunders, and may divert his darts from our hearts. No other defence is often left againſt the ſtrength of judgments after ſin hath made its entrance. A <hi>holy ſeed in Jeruſalem,</hi> is the guard of it in the time of <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s Invaſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.13. <hi>The holy ſeed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof.</hi> Growth in ſin ripens judgments, turns Bloſſoms and Buds into Fruit, Rods into Scorpions. Grief for it turns ſcorpions into Rods, leſſens a judgment if not wholly prevents it. The Water of repentance is the beſt way to quench the flames of ſin, and ſparks of wrath. If good Men fall under a common judgment, it may be often for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this temper. This was <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion,<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41445:39"/> with the wicked in Common Judgments; becauſe though, they do not Commit the ſame ſins, yet they connive at their iniquities, and ſo are laſht with their rods, temporally chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not eternally puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It will ſweeten Judgments.</hi> Such may ſay of Judgment, as <hi>Paul</hi> of death, Oh Judgment where is thy ſting! 'Tis a double burden to lye under the weight of common Judgments, and the weight of common ſins; grief for them is a means to remove the guilt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eaſe thee of a Judgment. If we are concerned in mourning for ſin, we ſhall be more fit to honour God, if he makes us fall under his ſtroak. A holy ſorrow will bring us into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive frame. <hi>Aaron</hi> had been, without queſtion, humbled for his timorous compliance with the people in the making of the golden Calf; and when God came to ſtrike him near in his own Children, he <hi>held his peace, Levit.</hi> 10.3. No doubt but his former humiliation fitted him for his preſent patience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Our repentance for our own ſins was never right, unleſs we are of this temper.</hi> Repentance is a juſtice towards God, and therefore is converſant about other mens ſins in a hatred of them. 'Tis for ſin as ſin, and ſin is ſin in whatſoever ſubject it be, and worthy of hatred according to right reaſon, and therefore that grace whereby a Man hates it in his own perſon, will engage him to hate it whereſoever it is: and we alwaies grieve for the encreaſe of that which is the object of our hatred. A truly juſt man hates the injury committed againſt another as well as that againſt himſelf. That filthineſs which diſpleaſeth a penitent in his own act, diſpleaſeth him in anothers act, there being the ſame adequate reaſon, and ſin being of the ſame nature againſt God in another as in himſelf. 'Tis <hi>All abominations,</hi> in the text; this is an argument of ſincerity: to mourn for one may be from ſelf intereſt, to mourn for all muſt be from a pure affection.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis an argument of a true affection to God.</hi> To mourn for ſin when it is rare, though groſs, is not ſo much a ſign of ſincerity, as to mourn for it when it is <hi>Epidemical,</hi> when the Foundations of godlineſs are out of courſe and the graces contrary to thoſe ſins are generally diſcountenanced: as it is a greater ſign of ſincerity to love the word, when it is generally ſlighted, than to love it when all admire it. What a noble affection had that <hi>Lady in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that grieved not ſo much for the loſs of her Father, Husband, Friends, but bewailed the departure of <hi>the glory</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and implicitely at leaſt, the ſin that occaſioned it? How did her affection to God drown all carnal affections? Her ſorrow for the <hi>ark</hi> ſtifled the ſorrow of her travel, and the joy at the birth of her Son. <hi>She regarded it not.</hi> This is an evident token of affection, when we mourn moſt for the ſins which moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and the ſins of thoſe perſons that ſeem to be nearer to God, and caſt moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon his name.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Shall we be outſtript by Idolaters?</hi> The mourning for others ſins was a cuſtom kept up in <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their revolt from God unto <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> When <hi>Naboth</hi> was put to death for a pretended crime of blaſphemy, a faſt was proclaimed to <hi>lament his ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.12. and though with a wicked intention, to palliate a murther with the cloak of religion, yet it evidenceth this mourning for the groſs ſins of others to be a common ſentiment among them, and practiſed upon the like occaſions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>We have juſt fears of judgments.</hi> We know not whence they will come, from the <hi>North</hi> or from the <hi>South.</hi> God ſets up his warnings in the Heavens: we behold him frowning and preparing his arrows; and are we careleſs in what poſture we ſhall meet him? He hath <hi>Spit in our faces,</hi> made us a by-word and reproach; ſhould we not be humbled? <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>If her Father had ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed?</hi> God ſeems to be departing. He hath as it were kept open market a long time, he ſeems now to be putting up his wares, removing his Candleſtick, withdrawing the power of his Ordinances, recalling his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the light is almoſt in the ſocket. The voice of God is received with a deaf ear, the reproofs and admonitions of God have not a kindly operation, the ſigns of judgment amaze us, and the amazement quite vaniſhes. We ſtart like a man in a dream, and fall back upon our pillow and ſnort out our ſleep. Can we expect God to ſtay? He ſeems to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the threſhold of the Temple, come down already from the <hi>Cherubims;</hi> and is it not high time to bewail our own ſins, and the Common abominations, that have ſo polluted the place of his habitation, that we may ſay we cannot ſee how God can ſtay with honour to himſelf? If we bewail the ſins that provoke him to it, God may ſtay; if he will not, let us at leaſt ſhew this affection to him at parting. This is not a thing unbecoming the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſtian. Doth not the <hi>Spirit grieve</hi> for the ſins of others which play the wantons with the grace of God? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.</hi> The holy Spirit hath no ſins of his own to grieve for. Shall we be above that which the Spirit of God thinks himſelf not above? Shall we refuſe mourning for that which goes to the heart of the Holy Ghoſt? Let us therefore examine what are our own ſins, what are the abominations of the times and places wherein we live; make inquiſition for the one, that we may drag them out before the Lord: And in our places endeavour to ſtop and reform the other. As the true fire of Love to God will melt us into tears, ſo it will heat us into zeal. He is no friend, that will complain of a toads being in another's boſom, but not ſtrive to kill it. It will ſhew either Cowardice or falſeneſs. That zeal is wild-fire that is not accompanied with an holy ſorrow, and that ſorrow is crude which is not accompanied with a godly Zeal.</p>

Firſt in defection, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>And</hi> Adam <hi>was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> The fall of man was the fruit of the Womans firſt Doctrine, and therefore ſhe is not ſuffered to teach any more; the Woman was deceived by the Serpent, and ſo drew her Husband, and whole Poſterity, into ruine. Some of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> bring this place as an Argument againſt Womens reading the Scripture; but no reaſon can conclude it from this place. How can the Spirit of God prohibit their reading the Scripture in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and the inſtruction of their Families, ſince Women are among thoſe who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for reading the Scripture? <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. where the honourable Women are mention'd. And <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> are applauded for their inſtruction of <hi>Timothy.</hi> Are not Women bound by that command of <hi>Peter, to give a reaſon of their Faith to any that ſhall ask them,</hi> unleſs they would have Women Chriſtians without reaſon? What was the Office of thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Widdows in the Primitive times, but to inſtruct the younger Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? But this is not to be charged upon all the <hi>Papiſts: Becanus</hi> only is the man that <hi>Rivet</hi> mentions<note n="*" place="margin">Iſagog. ad Script. c. <hi>13.</hi> p. <hi>990, 991.</hi>
               </note> And becauſe upon this declaration of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſome might be dejected by the conſideration of the deep hand the Woman had in the firſt fall, in the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them for it, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> brings in a <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Notwithſtanding her guilt in defection, her puniſhment in child-bearing, ſhe hath as good a right to ſalvation as the Man: So that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here anſwers by way of <hi>anticipation, an Objection</hi> which might be made, whether the guilt contracted by the Woman, and the puniſhment inflicted, might not hinder her eternal ſalvation. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers, <hi>No.</hi> Though ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and the pain of child-bearing was the puniſhment of that firſt ſin, yet the Woman may arrive, to everlaſting ſalvation notwithſtanding that pain, if ſhe be adorn'd with thoſe graces which are neceſſary for all Chriſtians. Though the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment remain, yet the believing Woman is in the Covenant of Grace, under the wings of the Mediator of that Covenant, if ſhe have Faith, the condition of the Covenant, which works by Love and Charity, and is attended with holineſs, and renewal of the heart.</p>

The firſt I ſuppoſe is principally intended, (for the Apoſtle here would ſignify ſome ſpecial comfort to Women under that curſe. But the preſervation of Women in Child-bearing was a common thing teſtified by dayly experience in the worſt, as well as in the beſt Women, and Chriſtianity did not bring the profeſſors of it into a worſe eſtate in thoſe things which immediately depended upon God, or make the Children Vipers, not to come into the world without the death of their Mothers.) Yet a temporal preſervation may be included; for when an eternal ſalvation is promis'd, temporal ſalvation is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, according to the methods of Gods wiſdom and goodneſs in the courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there being in all ſuch promiſes a tacit reſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> if God ſees it good for us; and the manner of their preſervation alſo, wherein the preſervation of a believer differs from that of an unregenerate Perſon. Others are preſerved by God, as a merciful Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, in a way of common Providence, for the keeping up of the world; But believers are preſerv'd in the way of promiſe and covenant, in the exerciſe of faith, and by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love of God, as a tender Father, and their God in covenant with them through Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning the Puniſhment.</hi> Child-bearing it ſelf is not the puniſhment, but the pain in it. For the bleſſing <hi>[Increaſe and multiply]</hi> was given in Innocency. This puniſhment is peculiar to the Woman, and ſuperadded to that inflicted upon the Man, wherein the Woman alſo hath her ſhare, though it lay heavieſt upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſhoulders. And becauſe this puniſhment is the greater, it is diſputed in the <hi>Schools</hi> whether <hi>Adam</hi>'s or <hi>Eve</hi>'s <hi>ſin were the greater.</hi> Various Opinions there are. We may, I think, ſafely make theſe <hi>Concluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of the kind of ſin it was equal in both:</hi> They both had an equal pride, an equal aſpiring to be like God: For in all probability, <hi>Eve</hi> gave not her Husband the fruit to eat, without acquainting him with the reaſons which mov'd her to eat it, as alſo the advantage ſhe expected from it. And God chargeth this aſpiring humour upon the man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Man,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>is become like one of us.</hi> Both of them therefore embrac'd the temptation as it was directed, and ſwallowed the fruit, with an expectation to be like, not the Angels, (as ſome think, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. <hi>You ſhall be as Gods, Elohim;</hi>) but like God himſelf, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>v.</hi> 22. in that Ironical ſpeech, where the Lord God <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Man is become like one of us.</hi> They both believed the Serpent, both broke the command in eating the fruit, both were guilty of this aſpiring Ambition. Some indeed think <hi>Eve</hi> ate twice of the fruit, once before the Serpent, and the other time when ſhe gave her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>She did eat, and gave to her Husband with her, and he did eat</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mariana in loc.</note>. But that is not ſo clear in the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of the firſt motion to this ſin,</hi> Eves <hi>ſin was the greater.</hi> She was the ſeducer of <hi>Adam,</hi> which the Apoſtle expreſſeth in the verſe before the <hi>Text. The Woman being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Where the Apoſtle intimates the Womans ſin in that reſpect to be greater than the mans. <hi>Adam</hi> was in it too, but the Woman deeper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In regard of the Womans condition, the ſin was greater on</hi> Adam <hi>'s part</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Eſtius in ſenten.</note>.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he, being <hi>the Man, had more power to reſiſt,</hi> more ſtrength to argue the caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Eve <hi>had a ſtronger and craftier Adverſary to deal with,</hi> the <hi>ſubtilleſt of all the beaſts of the field, Gen.</hi> 3.1. animated and inſpired by a craftier Devil. The ſtronger the Tempter, the more excuſable the ſin. <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted by <hi>Eve,</hi> but <hi>Eve</hi> by the Serpent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Eve <hi>had the command of not eating immediately from her Husband;</hi> which laid not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo ſtrong a tye upon her as it did upon him, who had it immediately from the mouth of God, and therefore was more certain of the verity of the Precept.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of what nature is this Puniſhment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis not a Puniſhment in a rigid ſenſe, nor continued as ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe 'tis not commenſurate to the nature of the ſin, neither is it that penalty which the Law required.</hi> Death was due, and death immediately upon the offence; but death was kept off by the interpoſition of the Mediator, and this which is leſs than death, inflicted at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The Mediator or Days-man interpoſed before this ſentence; for the promiſe of the Seed which ſhould <hi>bruiſe the Serpents head,</hi> preceded the pronouncing of this ſentence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, 16. God arms himſelf againſt both, but not with thoſe weapons they had deſerv'd. Capital Crimes are uſually attended with capital puniſhments, which draw a deſtruction upon the offender. Where death is deſerv'd, and a lighter puniſhment inflicted, it is rather
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41445:41"/> an act of clemency, than ſtrict Juſtice, and may be called by the name of a partial pardon, or reprieve, as well as a puniſhment. 'Tis indeed a puniſhment when Conſcience racks a man with further expectation of torment, when it is but a Prologue to everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when through thoſe pains any fall into the place of everlaſting horrour. 'Tis then more properly a puniſhment, when it proceeds from an irreconcileable Juſtice, arm'd with Omnipotency in the Execution, not when it proceeds from an anger mix'd with mildneſs, and mitigated by the Interceſſions of a Mediator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis not a reparation of the injury done to God.</hi> One reaſon of the inſtitution of puniſhment is to repair the damage the Perſon offended ſuſtains by the malefactor, as far as he is capable. The injury done to God cannot be repaired by any temporary puniſhment. No nor indeed actually by an eternal one, though an eternal ſuffering is all the reparation a finite Creature is capable to make to the honour of God. A man is capable of making ſome kind of amends to his Neighbour for an offence done, but God being infinitely our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cannot have his honour repaired by any thing a Creature can do or ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis not continued as a part of Satisfaction to the juſtice of God.</hi> As though Chriſt needed the ſufferings of the Creature to make up the ſum which he was to pay for us, and which he hath already paid. 'Tis not, on the account of the death of Chriſt, purely a vindictive, but a medicinal act to a believer. 'Tis rather to awaken us than to Satisfy juſtice. As we wring a man by the noſe who is fallen into a ſwoon, not to have ſatisfaction from him for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury he may have done us, but to fetch him out of his fit. Theſe puniſhments are to awaken men to a ſight of their firſt ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The proper impulſive cauſe of puniſhment is wrath.</hi> Though this was the firſt cauſe of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet it is not inflicted in wrath upon a believer. Though at firſt it was an effect of Gods anger, yet in a beliver it is a fruit of Gods fatherly anger, wherein he acts with a compoſition of Judge &amp; Father. In inflicting it he preſerves the authority of a Judge: In preſerving under it, and pardoning the ſin for which it was inflicted, he evidenceth the affection of a Father. Puniſhment, as ſuch, is only to hurt, and make men reap the fruit of their iniquity: But the end of affliction in the intention of the perſon that doth afflict, is oftentimes to benefit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Yet it is in ſome ſort a puniſhment and ſomething more than an affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the meritorious cauſe, ſin.</hi> This is not inflicted <hi>ratione abſoluti dominii,</hi> but <hi>ratione meriti.</hi> 'Tis not an act of abſolute ſoveraignty, but a judicial legal act, upon the demerit of ſin. There are ſome afflictions which are not puniſhments, as in the caſe of the man that was born blind: Chriſt tells us that it was <hi>neither for his own ſin, nor for the ſins of his parents,</hi> but that God might be glorified, <hi>John</hi> 9.2.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> God in inflicting that blindneſs, reſpected neither the ſin of the man, nor the ſin of the parents, but the making him a paſſive ſubject of his glory, in our Saviours miraculous Cure. But in this caſe God reſpected the ſin of the woman as the cauſe and reaſon of the puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe if man had ſtood in innocency, neither this grief, nor indeed any other had been.</hi> The birth in innocency, would have been without ſorrow and grief, as the hunger and thirſt which would have been in <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſtate, would have been without that gnawing in the ſtomack and that pain which we find in thoſe defects, becauſe a ſtate of integrity and perfect righteouſneſs muſt needs be without grief. But after the fall all thoſe pains incident to man or woman, are fruits of the curſe of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This puniſhment doth not hinder Salvation, though it be continued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall lay down theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> to clear up this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God intended not in the acceptance of Chriſts mediation to remove in this life all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced after the fall.</hi> God takes away the eternal, but not the temporal. For this very puniſhment was threatned after his acceptance of Chriſts mediation, and after the compact and covenant between the Father and the Son, about their redemption of mankind, becauſe the promiſe preceded the threatning, and the mediatory covenant preceded the promiſe. Some parts of Chriſts purchaſe are only payable in another life, and ſome fruits of Redemption God intends for growth only in another ſoyl; ſuch are Freedom from pain, diſeaſes, death &amp; ſin. And therefore the laſt day, when believers ſhall be gather'd together, is called by way of excellency, the <hi>day of Redemption, Eph.</hi> 4.30. as if we had nothing of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion properly in this life, becauſe we have it not compleat. And it is called upon this account the <hi>time of refreſhing</hi> and <hi>the time of the reſtitution of all things, Act.</hi> 3.19, 21. when all things ſhall be reſtored to their primitive compleatneſs, and we ſhall have a full refreſhment by a removal of all the evils which we ſuffer by reaſon of ſin. So that the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt extends not to a preſent removal of all the effects of the curſe, pains of the body, death of relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ground is not reſtored to its original vigor and fruitfulneſs, man muſt ſtill eat his bread in the ſweat of his brows, women muſt ſtill bring forth with ſorrow, our lives muſt waſte by a continual invaſion of weakneſſes and diſeaſes, we muſt drop one after another into the grave, ſend ſome before us, and leave others to come after us; tho God in mercy doth mitigate theſe, in ſome more, in ſome leſs, according to his Soveraign pleaſure; and though thoſe curſes do materially continue, yet they are attended with a bleſſing, the fruits of Chriſts purchaſe. But the full value of Chriſts ſatisfaction will appear, when there ſhall be a new Heaven, &amp; a new Earth, when the day of Redemption ſhall dawn, and all tears be wiped from believers eyes. But God never promiſed the total removal of them in this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41445:42"/> life to any Saint, no though he ſhould have all the Faith and Holineſs of all the Catalogue of Saints in the book of life centred in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt never intended in the payment of the price of our Redemption, the preſent removal of them.</hi> He interpoſed himſelf before this ſentence was pronounced (for the promiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the threatning) and therefore ſhew'd himſelf content, that thoſe marks ſhould be ſet upon that ſin, though he prevented by his Mediation the dreadful ſentence of eternal death. Chriſt never expected it; for the Compact between the Father and the Son did not run in this ſtrain. Chriſt's Enemies were not preſently upon his aſcenſion to be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, whereof death is not the leaſt; but he was to ſit at the right hand of God, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; neither can we expect to be rid of our burdens, till Chriſt's Victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be fully compleat. He ſent after his Aſcenſion the Spirit to be our Comforter, which ſuppoſeth a ſtate wherein we ſhould need comfort; and when are we under a greater neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of comfort, than when the puniſhment of ſin is actually inflicted on us? The Spirit was to comfort us in the abſence of our Saviour, and conſequently in the abſence and want of thoſe fruits of Redemption which are not yet compleated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt intended, and did actually take away the Curſe of thoſe Puniſhments from every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> As Chriſt came to take away the guilt of ſin, ſo by conſequence he took away the curſe of puniſhment; for as he was <hi>not a miniſter of ſin,</hi> ſo he was not a miniſter of the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17. for he himſelf by taking the curſe upon himſelf, took it off from us; ſo that though the curſe remains materially, yet it doth not formally. As when man felt his underſtanding and will were not deſtroyed, but the purity and healthfulneſs of thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which made up his well-being were loſt: So in Redemption, the temporal puniſhment is not remov'd, but the Curſe, which is the ſting in that puniſhment, and is indeed the eſſential part of it, is remov'd, ſince the anger of God is pacified by the death of Chriſt. Death was a Curſe upon Man for ſin, yet the death of a Believer falls not under that title; becauſe Chriſt hath taken away the ſting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56. <hi>Oh death! where is thy ſting,</hi> &amp;c. And the Victory over it, he ſaith, is given us through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Whence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> puts even death it ſelf, and things preſent, into the Catalogue of Priviledges, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Not that death ſimply in it ſelf is a Priviledge, but death as conquered, and as attended with conſequent bleſſings, is ſo to a Believer. Now the ſame reaſon is for all the other parts of the Curſe, which were either Prologues to, or Attendants upon death. And as Chriſt deſtroyed death by raiſing his own body from the grave, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taking from death the power of perpetually retaining man: So in the ſame manner he hath took away thoſe puniſhments, that they ſhall not perpetually remain, though they do for a time. But <hi>when death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> all the Attendants on it ſhall undergo the ſame fate. Though the Curſe was not immediately the work of the Devil, yet that which procur'd it was; and Chriſt's intention being to take away ſin, it was alſo to take away the Curſe, which was intentionally the Devils work, his chief aim being to bring men under the Curſe, by enticing them to ſin. The end of his manifeſtation was, <hi>to deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. Chriſt therefore bore our infirmities, our natural penal infirmities, though not our natural ſinful ones, unleſs morally, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſuffering for them; he bore the infirmity of our Nature, though not our perſonal infirmities. He endur'd pain, and grief, and death, and greater than we can endure; but he did not bear every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular pain and diſeaſe which ariſeth from ſin, and a particular cauſe; yet by ſatisfying the Juſtice of God, which required death, he ſatisfied for all other pains which were parts of the Curſe, though he did not formally feel them; ſo that no longer they remain as a Curſe, no more than death it ſelf is a Curſe to a Believer. Now, as Chriſt by his death upon the Croſs did remove the ſting of death from every Believer, and ſanctifie it, though he did not die every kind of death which a man may die; ſo by enduring pain and grief, and being a man of ſorrows, he took away the ſting of all thoſe pains, which are fruits of the Curſe, though they were of a different kind from thoſe he hath himſelf endured. This I have added to prevent an Objection that may be made, that Chriſt endured not this particular pain, and therefore the Curſe is not taken away.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence it will follow, that to a Believer the very nature of theſe Puniſhments is alter'd.</hi> Whence ariſeth a mighty difference between the ſame puniſhments when ſuffered by a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and by an unregenerate man. Though they are <hi>materially</hi> the ſame, yet not <hi>formally,</hi> nor <hi>eventually.</hi> In the one the ſting remains, in the other it is pull'd out. The one is an earneſt of eternal torture, and a ſprinkling of Hell; the other is in order to ſalvation, and ſanctified by the Blood of Chriſt. Chriſt by his Croſs hath made our Judgments to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Phyſick, and turn'd a Believers puniſhments into purges. The intention of the Agent makes a vaſt difference, There is a great difference between a puniſhment edg'd with a a Princes wrath, and thoſe which are ſweetened with a Fathers affection; much difference between a Chirurgians Launce, and a Tyrants Wound. The Cord that binds a Malefactor and a Patient, may be made of the ſame Hemp, and a Knife only go between; but it binds the Malefactor to Execution, the other to a Cure. In a Believer they bring forth <hi>the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, Heb.</hi> 12.11. ſuch fruits of righteouſneſs which engender peace and joy in the Soul. That which brings ſuch excellent effects is rather an argument of love in the Inflicter, and ſo cannot come under the full notion of a puniſhment. God
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41445:42"/> comforts the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were to go into Captivity, by a Goſpel promiſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. <hi>I will heal their back ſlidings, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from them.</hi> The puniſhment was continued, for they never returned into their Countrey in the form of a common wealth; but the anger was removed, ſo that the Captivity of the Believers among them was not the effect of God's wrath as a Judge, ſince they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his magnificent love as a Father. The change of our relation to God makes a change in the nature of the puniſhment; though the puniſhment threatned may be inflicted and continued, yet the anger in that puniſhment may be turned away.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Therefore all temporal puniſhments of Original ſin, though they remain, do not prejudice a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers preſent intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They cut not off his relation to God.</hi> A Son is as much a Son under the Rod, as in the Boſom; neither the Fathers ſtroke, nor the Childs grief, diſſolve that dear relation: Nay a Father may ſhew more of a true paternal affection in his Chaſtiſements than in his Careſſes. The Branches which are battered with Sticks, may be nearer the Root than thoſe that flouriſh at their eaſe. Chriſt while a Man of ſorrows was pronounced by God, his well beloved Son, and bore our puniſhment, not only without forfeiting his Fathers affection, but with a high gratification of him: Neither doth God's viſiting the ſeed of Chriſt with ſtripes cut off their relation to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. <hi>Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with Rods.</hi> Whoſe tranſgreſſions? <hi>v.</hi> 30 <hi>His Children.</hi> Whoſe Children? Even the Children of him whom he would make <hi>the firſt born, higher than the Kings of the Earth, v.</hi> 27. Which cannot be underſtood literally of <hi>David,</hi> or his Lineal Poſterity in the Jewiſh Kingdom, who were never higher than the Kings of the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They debar not from the preſence of God.</hi> God may be, and is as near to us in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he is in puniſhing. 'Tis not the cloud that interpoſeth between the Sun and us, that alters the Suns courſe, or obſtructs its influences. Chriſt took not off the badges of Original Guilt from thoſe diſciples which had the greateſt intereſt in his affections; he left them in a ſinful world to endure the fruits of ſin; he ſent them not to eaſe, pleaſure, and a quiet and painleſs life, but to labour, toyl, and ſweat; yet promiſed that he would abide with them, that he and his Father would manifeſt themſelves to them. And he turned that ſweat and pain which was the fruit of ſin, by his preſence with them, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the glory of God, and the good of themſelves in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They break not the Covenant:</hi> His Rod and his Stripes tho they ſeem to break our Backs, make no breaches in his Covenant, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.32, 33, 34. he will viſit tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Rods, but he will not <hi>ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail, nor break his Covenant.</hi> No, they are rather covenant mercies, when they break our Hearts, and are means by his Grace to make our Stony Hearts more Fleſhy. He makes even thoſe diſpenſations which were pronounced for puniſhment, to bring forth covenant mercies, and the rich fruits of his grace to grow upon the ſour crab-ſtock of his judgments. <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. is ſaid to bleſs his Children, tho he predicts ſmart afflictions to come upon them; they are rankt among the bleſſings, becauſe the covenant ſhould remain firm. The laſh removes not the inheritance. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Noli attendere quam poenam habes in flagello, ſed quem lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in Teſtamento.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Add to all this, <hi>That the firſt promiſe ſecures a believer under the ſufferings of thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Gods affection in the promiſe of bruiſing the Serpents head, was more illuſtrious than his wrath in the threatning. There are the Bowels of a Father in the promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was the voice of a Judge in the Sentence. God brought Sugar with his Potion, and adminiſtred his Cordial before he ſtruck with his Lance. And therefore that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which commenc'd after the promiſe, can no more prejudice the fruits of the promiſe to a Believer, than the Law, which was given 430 <hi>years</hi> after the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> could diſannul that, and make it of no effect, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues in another caſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. Much leſs can the threatning denounced immediately after the promiſe, change the veracity of God, in that which was freſh in his mind at the very time of his threatning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be askt, <hi>What is the reaſon theſe puniſhments are continued ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>'Tis frequent with God to inflict a temporal puniſhment after pardon.</hi> Not as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> aſſert, in order to ſatisfaction. <hi>Moſes</hi> his unbelief hindred him from coming unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo that when he deſired to go over <hi>Jordan,</hi> God was wroth with him, cut him off ſhort, and commands him ſilence, <hi>Deut</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Speak to me no more of this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>On Gods part.</hi> 2. <hi>On our part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>On Gods part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis congruous to the wiſdom of God to leave them upon us while we are in the World.</hi> Since God created man to gain glory by his actions, but was preſently after his creation diſgrac'd and diſparag'd by him; it ſeems agreeable to the wiſdom of God, not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to bring him to his former ſtate, but to leave ſome marks of his diſpleaſure upon Man to mind him of the ſtate whence he was fallen, the miſery he contracted, and the neceſſity of flying to his mercy for ſuccour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis congruous to the holineſs of God.</hi> God keeps up thoſe puniſhments as the Rector
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41445:43"/> and Governour of the World, to ſhew his deteſtation of that ſin which brought a diſorder and deformity upon the Creation, and was the firſt act of diſhonour to God, and the firſt pollution of the Creature. 'Tis an high vindication of the Holineſs and Authority of God, and the Majeſty and Purity of his Law, to puniſh ſin in them that are dear to him upon anothers righteouſneſs, whereby he evidenceth, that he hates ſin in all, and will not wink at it, or approve of it. So he pardoned <hi>David,</hi> but for the honour of his name, which had been blaſphemed by occaſion of <hi>David</hi>'s ſin, he would leave the ſmart of it upon his Family, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis a declaration of his Juſtice.</hi> 'Tis not congruous to the Juſtice of God not to leave ſome marks of his anger againſt that ſin, which cauſed him to be at the expence of his Sons Blood, and is the ſource of all thoſe evils whereby God is injur'd, for which the Redeemer bled, and by which the Spirit is grieved. Since Pardon doth not, neither can alter the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of ſin, but that will continue; and what is once meritoriouſly a capital crime in its own nature, can never be otherwiſe; God may for the demonſtration of his juſtice, inflict and continue ſomething upon the creature, though he free him from actual condemnation. We ſhould not be ſo ſenſible of the juſtice of God in the death of Chriſt, did we not feel ſome ſtrokes of it upon our ſelves, nor what the purchaſe of our redemption did coſt our Saviour: What we hear doth not ſo much affect as what we feel. That which brought diſorder into Gods Government of the world, and made him change the Scene of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, may very juſtly have ſome ſignal remark upon it, notwithſtanding the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially when the fruits of it are not fully compleat: For ſince Man was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate end of the creation of this lower world, and ſince all Creatures were made for the ſervice of Man, that he might be fit for the ſervice of his righteous Creator, he did by his fall violate the order of the Creation, and ſubjected it to the ſervice of the Devil, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Creature, and an enemy to God the chief Lord of the World, and ſo did deprave the order of the univerſe, and endeavoured to fruſtrate the end of God, and the end of all the Creatures. 'Tis very rational to think, that tho God out of his infinite compaſſion would not loſe his creature, yet that he ſhould ſet ſuch a badge upon him, that ſhould make him ſenſible of a depravation he had wrought in the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis uſeful to magnify his love.</hi> We ſhould not be ſenſible of what our Saviour ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor how tranſcendently he lov'd us, if the puniſhment of ſin had been preſently removed upon the firſt promiſe. Nay how then could he have died in the fulneſs of time, which was neceſſary to the demonſtration of Gods love, ſatisfaction of his juſtice, and the ſecurity of the Creatures happineſs? God adds the threatning to the promiſe as a dark colour to ſet off and beautify the brighter. As Chriſt ſuffered that he might have compaſſion on us; ſo are we puniſhed that we might have an eſtimation of him. When <hi>Paul</hi> cries out of the body of death, ſo when we cry out of the puniſhment of ſin, it ſhould raiſe our thankfulneſs for redeeming love, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. We never know the worth of mercy, till we feel the weight of miſery. The ſharper the pains of ſin, the higher are our valuations of redeeming mercy. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.2. <hi>In that day ſhall the branch of the Lord be beautiful. and glorious.</hi> In what day? After great puniſhments, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and in the <hi>foregoing chapter.</hi> He appears moſt beautiful to us when we are under the laſh for ſin. As ſin continues in us, that the juſtifying grace of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs might more appear to us, ſo puniſhment continues on us, that redeeming love might be more prized by us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>On our parts.</hi> 'Tis uſeful to us;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To make us abhor our firſt defection and ſin.</hi> 'Twas great, and is not duly conſidered by us.<note n="*" place="margin">Kellet Miſcel.</note> This ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is the worſt that ever was committed in the world; <hi>Extenſively,</hi> though not <hi>Intenſively,</hi> worſe than the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> or the <hi>ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.</hi> In reſpect that thoſe are but the effects of it, and branches of that corrupt root. Alſo becauſe thoſe ſins hurt only the perſons ſinning, but this drew down deſtruction upon the whole world, and drove thouſands into everlaſting Fire and Brimſtone. 'Tis not fit that this which was the murder of all Mankind, the diſorder of the Creation, the diſturbing of God's reſt in the works of his Hands, ſhould be paſt over without a ſcar left upon us to make us ſenſible of the greatneſs of the evil. Though the wounds be great upon our Souls, yet they do not ſo much affect us as thoſe ſtrokes upon our Bodies. This certainly was one main end of God in this; to what purpoſe elſe did he (after the promiſe of reſtauration, and giving our firſt parents the comfort of hearing the head of their great ſeducer threatned to be bruiſed by the Seed of the Woman) order this puniſhment, but to put them in mind of the cauſe of it, and ſtir up a ſtanding abhorrency of it in all ages of the world? Had not this been his intent, he would never have uſher'd it in by a promiſe, but <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> have ſhowered down a deſtroying judgment upon the world, as he did upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> without any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table word preceding. God inflicts thoſe puniſhments both to ſhew his own, and excite our deteſtation of this ſin: <hi>He binds us in thoſe fetters to ſhew us our work and our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein we have exceeded, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To make us fear to ſin, and to purge it out.</hi> Sin hath riveted it ſelf ſo deep, that eaſy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines will not diſplace it. It hath ſo much of our affections, that gentle means will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce us from it: We ſhall hate it moſt, when we reap the puniſhment of it. Puniſhment
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41445:43"/> is inflicted as a guard to the law, and the ſecurity of righteouſneſs from the corrupt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Creature. So it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Plato</hi> calls puniſhment. As death is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the deſtruction of ſin in the Body, ſo are the leſſer puniſhments continued for the reſtraint of ſin in our lives. We need further converſions, cloſer applications of our ſelves to God, more quick walks to him, and fixedneſs with him. Gods ſmitings are to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our turnings. As it was the fruit of <hi>Jacobs trouble to take away ſin, Iſa.</hi> 27.9. So it is a great end of God in thoſe common puniſhments of mankind to weaken corruption in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever by them. Therefore when we have any more remarkable ſenſe of thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let us ſee what wounds our ſin gets thereby: How our hatred of it is encreaſed. If we find ſuch gracious effects, we ſhall have more reaſon to bleſs God for it, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it. Oh happy troubles, when they repair, not ruine us; when they pinch us and cure us, like Thunder, which, though it trouble the Air, diſperſes the infectious vapours mixed with it, or the Tide, which though turning the ſtream of the River againſt its natural courſe, carries away much of the filth with it at its departure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To exerciſe Grace.</hi> Puniſhments of themſelves have no power to ſet any grace on work, but rather excite our corruptions, but the grace of God accompanying them makes them beneficial for ſuch an end. God hath to a believer altered the commiſſion of ſuch puniſhments, they are to exerciſe our Faith, improve our patience, draw us nearer in acts of recumbency; but he hath given them no order to impair our grace, waſte our faith, or deaden our hopes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith and Truſt,</hi> 1. Tim. 5.5. <hi>She that is deſolate trusts in God.</hi> The lower the ſtate, the greater neceſſity, and greater obligation to truſt; ſuch exerciſes manifeſt, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we are in, is ſanctified to us. As ſin is ſuffered to dwell in a regenerate Man to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the exerciſe of Faith, ſo is the puniſhment of ſin continued for the ſame end. The continuance of it is a mighty ground of our confidence in God. We experiment the righteouſneſs of God in his threatning, and it is an evidence he will be the ſame in his promiſe. When we bear the marks of his punitive juſtice, it is an evidence that he will keep up the credit of his mercy, in the promiſe, as well as of his juſtice in the puniſhment, both being pronounced at the ſame time; the good of the one is as ſure by God's grace to our faith, as the ſmart of the other is by our deſert to that ſin. The continuance therefore of thoſe puniſhments may be uſed by a Believer, as a means to fix a ſtronger confidence in God; for if he were not true to the one, we might ſuſpect his truth in the other; If God ſhould be careleſs of maintaining the honour of his truth in his threatnings, we ſhould have reaſon to think that he would be careleſs of maintaining the honour of it in his promiſes, and thereupon be filled with deſpondencies. What comfort could we have in an unrighteous God? The righteouſneſs of God in inflicting puniſhment, is but a branch of that eſſential righteouſneſs of his nature, which obligeth him to be righteous in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his promiſe too. 'Tis a mighty ſupport to faith, that the righteous God loveth righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obedience in a Believer hath a greater luſtre by them.</hi> It was the glory of <hi>Job</hi> that he preſerved his Integrity under the ſmarteſt troubles. To obey a God always ſmiling is not ſo great an act of Loyalty, as to obey a God frowning and ſtriking, 'Tis the crown of our obedience to follow our God though he viſits us with ſtripes. 'Tis a noble temper to love that hand which ſtrikes us, and chearfully ſerve that Father which laſheth us: Our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is too low when it muſt be excited by a ſucceſſion of favours, and cannot run to God unleſs he allures it by ſmiles. 'Tis then a generous and ſincere obedience, when we can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him with a ſword in his Hand, truſt him though he kill us, love him though he ſtone us, and as the <hi>Perſians</hi> did by the Sun, adore him when he ſcorcheth, as well as when he refreſheth us. Were theſe puniſhments wholly abſent, we ſhould not have a riſe for ſo heroick faith and love; and our holineſs in this ſtate would want much of its luſtre.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Humility.</hi> Theſe puniſhments are left upon us to allay our pride, and be our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers of our deplorable miſcrriage. It had been an occaſion of pride in us to be freed from puniſhment at the firſt appearance of a Mediator. 'Tis reaſonable the Soul ſhould have occaſions to exerciſe it ſelf in a grace contrary to that firſt ſin pride, which was the cauſe of the fall. We affected to be Gods, and puniſhment is left that we may know we are but Men, which is the end of judgments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord, that the Nations may know they are but Men;</hi> we ſhould otherwiſe think our ſelves Gods. We are ſo inclin'd to ſin, that we need ſtrong reſtraints, and ſo ſwell'd with a natural pride againſt God, that we need Thorns in the Fleſh to let out the corrupt matter. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hanging the Rod over us makes us lick the duſt, and acknowledge our ſelves to be altogether at the Lords mercy. Though God hath pardon'd us, he will make us wear the halter about our Necks to humble us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Patience.</hi> Were there no puniſhments, there would be but little occaſion for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This grace would not have had its extenſive exerciſe, its full formation without ſuch ſtrokes left upon the creature. Reſignation to God, which is the beauty of grace, would not come to its due maturity and ſtature without ſuch trials. So that in theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the continuance, we ſee they are rather advantages to Salvation, than hindrances, by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41445:44"/> promoting through the influence of God's grace, thoſe graces in us which are neceſſary to a happy ſtate.</p>
            <p>Uſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>See the infinite mercy of God,</hi> who, when upon the defection of our firſt Parents he might have burnt up the whole world as he did <hi>Sodom,</hi> would upon the Redeemers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who ſtept in, impoſe ſo light a puniſhment upon that ſin; 'tis but light in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what the nature of ſin deſerves, every ſin being a contempt of the Majeſty of God, and a ſlight of his Authority; and that ſin having greater aggravations attending it. 'Tis a merciful puniſhment, it might have been an everlaſting damnation: God might have left us to the firſt ſentence of the law, and made no exchange of eternal death for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral pains: He might have been deaf to the voice of a Mediator, and put his mercy to ſilence as he did <hi>Moſes, Speak no more of this matter;</hi> but his Bowels pull his Juſtice by the Arm, and hinder that fatal ſtroke; and a Mediator by his interpoſition, breaks off the full blow from us, by taking it upon himſelf, and ſuffers only ſome few ſmart drops to light upon us. Oh wonderful mercy! that our puniſhment ſhould not hinder, but rather further our everlaſting happineſs by incomprehenſible grace. Let not then our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſin hinder our thankfulneſs. Let our Mouths ſwell with praiſe, while our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies crumble away by diſeaſes, and Relations drop from us by death. Let us love God's glory, admire his mercy, while we feel his Arrows: Whatever our puniſhments are, there is more matter for praiſe than murmuring.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How ſhould we bewail original ſin, the firſt fall of man.</hi> 'Tis a great ſlighting of God not to take notice either of his judicial, or fatherly proceedings. As we are to lament any particular ſin more eſpecially when the judgments of God, which bear the marks of that ſin in their foreheads, are upon a nation or perſon, ſo, though we are to bewail the ſin of our nature at all times, yet more ſignally when the ſtrokes of God, the remembrancers of it, are moſt ſignally upon us. A Child doth more particularly think of his fault when he is under the correcting rod for it. We ſhould ſcarce think of original ſin, if we did not feel original puniſhment. All the pains of ſin ſhould be conſidered as Gods Sermon to us, and we ſhould under them be afflicted with that ſin, as we may ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were, when they firſt heard the puniſhment denounc'd in Paradice, when they had a ſenſe of the flouriſhing Condition they had loſt for a ſlight temptation. To turn ſorrow for pain into ſorrow for our firſt ſin, is to ſpiritualize our grief, and ſanctify our paſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What an argument for patience under puniſhments is here?</hi> The continuance of them doth not hinder our Salvation. <hi>Shall a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> For ſuch a puniſhment that doth not hinder his eternal welfare, but by the grace of God, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith, rather promote it? God promiſed as well as threatned: both his mercy and righteouſneſs directs him to that which is moſt for his honour and our good. Let us not by any impatience charge infinite wiſdom with blindneſs or unrighteouſneſs. They were puniſhments at firſt, but by Faith in Chriſt, the deportment of a judge is changed into that of a Father. <hi>Druſius</hi> hath an obſervation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.10. <hi>In God will I praiſe his word, in the Lord will I praiſe his word.</hi> The firſt word <hi>Elohim</hi> is a name belonging to God as a <hi>judg,</hi> the 2d word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is a name of mercy; I will praiſe God, whether he deal with me in a way of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or in a way of <hi>mercy,</hi> when he hath thunder in his voice as well as when he hath hony under his tongue. Oh how ſhould we praiſe God, and pleaſure our ſelves by ſuch a frame? When our diſtreſſes ly hard upon us, we ſhould juſtify Gods holineſs. So the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> or rather Chriſt in the bearing our puniſhment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>But thou art holy,</hi> when he expoſtulates with God why he had forſaken him, juſtifies Gods holineſs. Howſoever thou dealeſt with me, thou art holy in all thy waies. Thou doſt me no wrong; why ſhould I complain when holineſs and hatred of ſin guides thee, in all thoſe actings with me?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>How earneſt ſhould we be to get rid of ſin?</hi> By pardon, by Sanctification. Guilt is the ſting of puniſhment. Sin only embitters trouble. The Remiſſion and Mortification of ſin is the health of the Soul. If the arrows head be out of a wound, the cure will be more eaſy. <hi>Look upon my affliction, and my pain, and forgive all my ſin,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 25.8. forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin would mitigate the ſharpneſs of his pain.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>How ſhould we act faith on God in Chriſt before, and under ſuch a condition of puniſhment?</hi> As we can never love God too much, becauſe he is the higheſt good, ſo we can never truſt God too much, becauſe he is one of immutable truth; when we are in ſtraits, it is not for want of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in God, but for want of Faith in us, that we are many times not preſerved. We diſtruſt God, and this is the cauſe we fall into many diſtreſſes, which otherwiſe would not come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, or be quickly removed from us. Did we graſp the promiſes cloſely, and plead them earneſtly, we ſhould often find the deliverance we deſire. We pray, but we pray not in Faith, we cry for deliverance, but not with confidence, we plead Gods power but forget his promiſe. Many temporal promiſes are not perform'd to us, not for want of truth in God, but for want of faith in us. Particular fiduciary acts will draw out the riches of a promiſe, for want of which we remain poor in the midſt of abundance. Some think that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Joſiah</hi> of his dying in peace, which phraſe is uſually meant in Scripture of a peacable death upon the bed, was not performed, becauſe <hi>Joſiah</hi> was out of the way againſt the precept of God, and therefore could not act faith requiſite to the fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41445:44"/> for faith is much dampt in its actings under preſent contracted guilt.<note n="†" place="margin">Tho. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</note> This Faith in promiſes for outward preſervation, is not an abſolute, infallible aſſurance that God will beſtow ſuch outward things (becauſe the promiſes themſelves are not abſolute) but it is rather an indefinite act of recumbency, and ſubmiſſion, referring it to his good pleaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. But it is certain we are very much defective in acting Faith upon promiſes for temporal mercies, becauſe it is an Epidemical diſtemper in us to truſt God with our Souls rather than with our bodies, and outward concerns.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Exerciſe Faith before ſuch a time.</hi> Furniſh your ſelves with the comforts of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the efficacy of the death of Chriſt. In bodily diſtempers our minds are diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and we cannot have that Freedom of thoughts and ſpiritual reflections. This is the way to engage God, who is the beſt aſſiſtant, <hi>a very preſent help in time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exerciſe it in the uſe of ſpiritual means.</hi> God never Commanded us to truſt him but in his own methods. That is not truſt in God which is attended with any wilful Omiſſions. If we be careful in doing our duty, God will be careful in doing what belongs to him. Prayer is the beſt means for Faith to exerciſe it ſelf in. A ſpirit of Prayer before-hand is a ſign of good ſucceſs. When the heart is drawn out to cry, it is a ſign God ſtands ready with the mercy in his hand. Times of diſtreſs are times of calling upon, God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.6. <hi>In my diſtreſs I called upon the Lord, and he heard my cry.</hi> God is to be acknowledged in all our ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. In the beginning by prayer for his direction, in the end by praiſes for the ſucceſs. We are uſually more earneſt in trouble. We have not at all times an equal fervency. Chriſt himſelf (ſome ſay) had not, for when he was in his agony he <hi>prayed more earneſtly</hi> than before, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Act Faith upon the Relation God bears to you.</hi> He is our Father. We truſt earthly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and are confident they will not abuſe us. How much more ought we to truſt our heavenly Father, and not doubt of his ſincerity towards us? The greater the trouble, the more we ſhould plead Gods relation to us. Our Saviour in the garden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39, 42. at his entrance into his paſſion for us, prays to God by the title of <hi>my Father,</hi> whereas at other times he calls God Father without that appropriation; But now he would excite his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and truſt in God, and thoſe promiſes he had made him to aſſiſt him in that hour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Act Faith upon the attributes of God.</hi> There is nothing in God can affright a believer. There is not an attribute but ſeems fixed in God to encourage our dependance on him in any ſtrait, wiſdom, mercy, truth, omniſcience, power, juſtice too (for what comfort could we have to truſt in an unjuſt God?) All which attributes are promiſed to be aſſiſtant to a believer in any caſe of need, in the Covenant of grace, where God makes himſelf over to us as our God, and therefore all that God hath, and is, is promiſed there for our good.

Gods Omnipotence was the ground of our Saviours prayer to him in his diſtreſs, and that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeems to intimate his eyeing of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>He offered up prayers unto him that was able to ſave him from death.</hi> And, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.1. The Pſalmiſt, or rather Chriſt, pleads the power of God. <hi>Preſerve me O Lord, for in thee do I put my truſt,</hi>

The promiſe that preceded the threatning, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>bruiſing the Serpents head,</hi> the defeating all his plots and deſigns, whereof this was one, to bring man into a ſtate of puniſhment. There is a promiſe which hath been eſpecially tryed and made good, though all in the book of God have been found true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.30. <hi>The Word of the Lord is tryed.</hi> Not one word but the truth of it hath been tryed; but eſpecially this word, <hi>That God is a buckler to them that truſt in him,</hi> i. e. That he will preſerve and defend depending believers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Act Faith upon Chriſt.</hi> Hath God delivered Chriſt to death? It muſt be for ſome glorious end; not for deſtruction of the Creature, that might have been done without the death of his Son; but for remiſſion; if ſo, there is ſufficient ground to truſt him for every thing elſe. We have a merciful high Prieſt, which encourageth us to make our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him. He cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, our penal infirmities which he ſuffered, our ſinful infirmities for which he ſuffered. Where can he ſhew his mercy but in our miſery? Are we under Gods ſtrokes? Chriſt himſelf felt them, that he might the better pity us. Are we in ſuch caſes tempted to deſpond and diſtruſt? He felt ſuch fiery darts of the Devil that he might the better commiſerate us. Run to him and cry out, Bleſſed Redeemer, Compaſſionate high Prieſt, let thy pity break out to allay my grief, and ſupport my weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Take a few encouragements to fiduciary acts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing is more pleaſing to God.</hi> The continuance in Faith is the neceſſary condition of our Salvation. Nothing more honours him. We honour his wiſdom and goodneſs, when we acknowledge that he hath a ſingular care of his Creatures, and truſt him in his own methods; we own his skill in governing and his goodneſs in bringing every thing about to the beſt end. Chriſt hath given us the higheſt example of truſt, and highly pleaſed God in it, in coming into the world to dye upon Gods bare word and oath. 'Tis all we can do to glorifie God. Other graces glorifie ſome particular attribute, but confidence in God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies all in the lump, his wiſdom, righteouſneſs, faithfulneſs mercy, truth, omniſcience and power. There is no attribute but gives a particular encouragement to Faith, and there is no attribute but Faith returns a revenue of glory to. Deſpondency diſparageth the Fathers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41445:45"/> affection and the Redeemers love; if we do not truſt him, we imply that he hath not either wiſdom, or love, or power, or faithfulneſs enough to be truſted by us, and that his word is of no value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing is more ſucceſsfull.</hi> 'Tis the argument the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> or rather <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Preſerve me.</hi> Why? Becauſe <hi>I truſt in the.</hi> Truſt in God is a ſtrong argument to prevail with God for preſervation. All the ancient Fathers were delivered by God upon their <hi>truſt,</hi> Pſal. 22.4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted and thou didſt deliver them, they cryed unto thee, and were delivered, they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> Faith in Goſpel-promiſes is not a grace of a new date. 'Tis as old as <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as old as the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and ſucceſsful in all ages of the world. They were under new-Covenant promiſes, and had new-Covenant deliverances before the promiſes were actually ſealed by the blood of Chriſt. How much ſtronger ground have we of truſt now? Faith draws out the treaſures of God, and ſets God on work to diſplay both his wiſdom, goodneſs and power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. <hi>How great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee!</hi> Much more when Faith is vigorouſly acted. Unbelief binds Gods hands, Faith then draws forth that power which unbelief locks up. God is firſt the <hi>hope of Iſrael,</hi> and then <hi>the Saviour thereof in times of trouble,</hi> Jer. 14.8. of every one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Where God inſpires with a humble confidence in himſelf, there is hope of ſucceſs, for God will not fruſtrate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that which he hath been the author of in his Creature. <hi>David</hi> had found ſuch good evidence of this, that he tells God he would make bold with him upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.3. <hi>What time I am afraid I will truſt in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nothing more calms the ſpirit.</hi> A fiduciary reliance on God is the way to live free from fears and anxieties. Faith is an eſtabliſhing grace. By Faith we ſtand. What ſtorms would be in the minds of poor paſſengers in a Ship, as great as thoſe in the Sea, if they had no <hi>Pilot</hi> to direct them? How ſoon would the arrival of a skilful Steers-man, in whom they could confide, and that knew the ſhelves and rocks upon the coaſt, calm their diſquiets?</p>
            <p>Well then, to <hi>Sum up all,</hi> This very <hi>Scripture</hi> is a Letter of comfort, writ only to women in the ſtate of Child-bearing; claim it as your right by Faith. What comfort is here to appeal from the threatning to the promiſe, from God as a Judg to God as a Father, from God angry to God pacified in Chriſt? How comfortable is this, that when God ſeems to fight againſt you with his puniſhments, you can take off the edge of his weapons by the pleas of his promiſe? Oh bleſſed God, who arms a believer againſt himſelf, before he arms himſelf againſt a believer! You can never be under the curſe if you have Faith, as long as God is ſenſible of his own credit in the promiſe. In the material part of the puniſhment there is no difference between a believer and an unbeliever; <hi>Jacob</hi> is pincht with famine as well as the <hi>Canaanite;</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> is in Covenant, and hath a God in Heaven and a <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to preſerve him. God directs every pain in all by his providence, in believers by a particular love; every gripe in all the Phyſick he gives us. He orders even his <hi>contendings</hi> with his creature in ſuch a meaſure as <hi>the ſpirit</hi> may <hi>not fail before him;</hi> Iſa. 57.16.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Apoſtle</hi> having exhorted the Saints to whom he writes in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to <hi>abide</hi> in Chriſt, and to <hi>do righteouſneſs, v.</hi> 28.29. follows on this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, with ſeveral arguments and demonſtrations, that a true Chriſtian is not only bound to do ſo, but that he indeed doth ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From that <hi>hope</hi> which hath eternal happineſs for its Object, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. Where this hope is truly founded, it will inflame us with a deſire and endeavour after holineſs, which is a neceſſary means to attain it. There will be an endeavour to be like that Head here, which they hope to be perfectly like hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>contrariety of ſin</hi> to the Law of God. 'Tis not reaſonable, neither can there be ſuch a diſingenuous diſpoſition in any, to tranſgreſs the Laws of that perſon from whom only he expects his higheſt felicity; and the Law of God being pure and perfect, ſin being contrary unto it, muſt be filthy and unreaſonable. A Chriſtian who is guided by this Law, will not tranſgreſs it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the <hi>End of Chriſts coming,</hi> which was to <hi>take away ſin, v.</hi> 5. And a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought not to endeavour to fruſtrate the Ends of Chriſt's coming by the nouriſhment of that which he came to deſtroy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the <hi>Communion they have with Chriſt;</hi> abiding in him, they ſin not; if any man ſin, it is an evident ſign he hath not the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 6. nor ever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to that pattern. Where there is a Communion with Chriſt, it is neceſſary ſuch an one ſhould be righteous, becauſe Chriſt was ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From the <hi>firſt Author of ſin,</hi> the Devil; he that ſins, hath a communion with the Devil, <hi>v.</hi> 8. as he that doth righteouſneſs, hath a communion with Chriſt. And to maintain the deſign and works of the Devil, is to walk contrary to the end and deſign of Chriſt, which was to deſtroy the works of the Devil; thoſe therefore that indulge themſelves in ſin, are the Seed of the Devil.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From the <hi>New Nature of a Chriſtian,</hi> which hinders him from ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Various expoſitions there are of this. The greateſt difficulty lies in thoſe words; [<hi>Doth not commit ſin,</hi> and <hi>cannot ſin.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ought not to ſin.</hi> Cannot indeed is ſometimes taken for ought not; as <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>For we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> They had a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ability to hold their peace, but <hi>morally</hi> they could not, becauſe of Chriſt's Precept to them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thoſe things. What we cannot lawfully do, we cannot do; <hi>Non poſſumus quod non jure poſſumus;</hi> what we cannot honourably do, we are ſaid not to be able to do, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5. <hi>He could there do no mighty work.</hi> Chriſt had <hi>natural</hi> ability to do mighty works there, but <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> he could not, <hi>honourably</hi> he could not, becauſe of their unbelief, which was a moral hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance; and according to God's Methods, there was no hope of doing any good among them; their unbelief was ſo ſtrong, they gave him no opportunity to do any mighty work. But this is not the meaning of <hi>cannot</hi> here, <hi>ought not.</hi> For an unrenewed man ought not to ſin any more than a regenerate man. But the Apoſtle attributes here ſomething peculiar to the <hi>regenerate,</hi> adding the reaſon <hi>[becauſe he is born of God.]</hi> Though it carry in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an obligation in a higher manner than upon a meer natural man: He ought not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41445:46"/> to ſin, not only upon the general obligation which lies upon all men not to ſin, but upon the more ſpecial one of his ſtate, being a Son of God, which ought to be counted a moral impoſſibility by a righteous man. Regeneration gives a man no advantage to ſin, no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal licence, no internal liberty or ability to ſin; for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſeth this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, as well as an eſtabliſhment, not to ſin, becauſe they are born of God, which was a more ſpecial obligation upon them not to ſin, than what they had by nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He cannot ſin ſo eaſily.</hi> 'Tis not impoſſible, but difficult for him to ſin, becauſe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving grace, he receives a principle contrary to ſin, and ſo hath a principle of reſiſtance againſt it: Or, becauſe by that grace he is inclined not to ſin, and ſo there is <hi>inchoativè,</hi> an impoſſibility of ſinning, which ſhall hereafter be perfected; Not a ſimple impoſſibility, but <hi>ſecundum quid:</hi> He endeavours to work as one born of God, and follows the motions of the Spirit againſt the ſin to which he is tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He cannot ſin, i. e.</hi> 'tis a hard matter for him to ſin; for conſidering the efficacy of grace, and the aſſiſtances attending it, it is a difficult thing for a righteous man to be brought under the power of ſin; he may ſin eaſily in reſpect of the frailty of the fleſh, but not ſo eaſily in regard of the <hi>abiding of the Seed</hi> in him, which helps him to beware of ſin. Grace being a divine habit, hath the nature of a habit, which is to incline the perſon to acts proper to that habit, and facilitate thoſe acts, as a man that hath the habit of an Art or Trade, can with more eaſe work in it than any other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He cannot ſin, in ſenſu formali,</hi> as he is regenerate, or <hi>ex vi talis nativitatis.</hi> Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe it can do nothing but what pertains to the nature of it; as the heat cannot cool, unrighteouſneſs cannot do good. Fire doth not moiſten <hi>per ſe,</hi> nor Water naturally heat. But it is not ſaid, <hi>The Seed of God cannot ſin;</hi> but in the Concrete, <hi>He that is born of God;</hi> and <hi>he that hath the Seed remaining in him cannot ſin.</hi> A gracious man as a gracious man cannot ſin, for grace being a good habit, is not capable of producing acts contrary to its nature. Sin in a regenerate man proceeds not from his grace, but from his corruption. Grace cannot be the principle of evil. But becauſe his grace is imperfect, dwelling among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin, therefore a man ſins, though this principle in him keeps ſin from attaining a full dominion and ſuperiority. Yet though he doth ſin, his ſin is not the proper fruit of the <hi>form</hi> whereby he is regenerate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He cannot ſin in ſenſu compoſito;</hi> as long as he is regenerate, as long as the Seed remains in him, as long as he follows the motions of the Spirit, and Grace, which are able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the motions of concupiſcence; but he may give up the grace. As an impregnable Tower cannot be taken as long as it is defended by thoſe within; but they may fling away their Arms, and deliver it up. Grace <hi>quantum eſt ex parte ſua,</hi> renders a man impeccable, as long as it continues in him; as Innocency did render <hi>Adam</hi> immortal, as long as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in it. But we may <hi>ex culpâ noſtrâ,</hi> loſe it by mortal ſin, and ſo periſh, as <hi>Adam</hi> by his own will loſt the integrity of his Nature, and was thereby made ſubject to death. This is founded upon a falſe <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> viz. <hi>That Grace may be loſt:</hi> And the Text <hi>renders</hi> the being born of God, and the Seed remaining in us, to be the reaſon why we cannot ſin, not the condition of our not ſinning; for if it remains, and we cannot ſin therefore, how can any ſin come in to expel that which preſerves us from it? A man muſt ceaſe, according to what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here writes, to be born of God, before he can ſin in that ſenſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He doth not commit ſin, and cannot ſin,</hi> i. e. <hi>Grave peccatum,</hi> the mortal ſin, and perſiſt in it. The ſin of unbelief, which is called in Scripture by way of eminency [<hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>the Sin</hi>] 'tis the chief ſin the Spirit convinceth of; 'tis the ſin that <hi>eaſily beſets us, Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us,</hi> i. e. <hi>eſpecially unbelief.</hi> Though this be <hi>true,</hi> yet it is not the <hi>full</hi> meaning and ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>He doth not commit ſin, and cannot ſin,</hi> as the <hi>Devil doth,</hi> or as one that is of a diabolical nature, as one that is acted by the Devil; which is clear by the Antitheſis, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>He that commits ſin, is of the Devil, for the Devil ſins from the beginning.</hi> He cannot ſet himſelf againſt Chriſt, as the <hi>Devil</hi> doth, as the Phariſees did, in which reſpect our Saviour calls them the <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> for their remarkable and conſtant oppoſition to him. He cannot make a practice of ſin, and perſiſt in it, as the Devil doth, who began to ſin preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Creation, and continueth in it ever ſince. He <hi>ſins,</hi> the <hi>preſent</hi> tence noting the continued act of the Devil. Sin may be conſider'd <hi>two ways; viz.</hi> As to</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Act of ſin.</hi> Thus a Believer ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Habit of ſin,</hi> or cuſtom in it. When a man runs to ſin freely, willingly, and is not diſpleaſed with it. Thus a Believer doth not commit ſin, nor cannot ſin. He commits it not. <hi>Potiùs patitur quàm facit;</hi> he gives not a full conſent to it; he hates it while he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape it. He is not ſuch a committer of it, as to be the <hi>ſervant of ſin, John</hi> 8.34. <hi>He that commits ſin, is the ſervant of ſin;</hi> becauſe he ſerves <hi>with his mind the Law of God:</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows not all his thoughts and labour upon ſin, in making <hi>proviſion for the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 13.14. in being a Caterer for ſin: He <hi>yields</hi> not up his <hi>Members as Inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin;</hi> he doth not let <hi>ſin reign in his mortal body,</hi> nor yield a voluntary obedience to it in the luſts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 13. for, being God's <hi>Son,</hi> he cannot be ſins <hi>Servant;</hi> he cannot ſin in ſuch a manner, and ſo abſolutely, as one of the Devil's Children, one born of the Devil.</p>

The ſenſe of this <hi>cannot</hi> I ſhall lay down in ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not meant excluſively of leſſer ſins, or ſins of infirmity.</hi> There are ſins of daily incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and lighter skirmiſhes; there are ſome open, ſome ſecret aſſaults, a multitude of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret faults, Pſal.</hi> 19.12. undiſcernable and unknown. Every good man is like <hi>Jacob,</hi> though he hath one thigh ſound, he hath another halting. I do not find that ever God intended to free any in this life from the remainders of ſin: What he hath not evidenc'd to have done in any, we may ſuppoſe he intended not to do. 'Tis a total Apoſtacy, not a partial Fall, that the Covenant provides againſt. Chriſt in his laſt prayer, prays for Believers preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gradual ſanctification, not for their preſent perfection. The very Office of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy erected in Heaven, ſuppoſeth ſins after regeneration, and during our continuance in the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little Children, I write unto you that you ſin not; and if any man ſin; we have an Advocate with the Father. In many things we offend all, James</hi> 3.2. Not only you that are the inferior ſort of Chriſtians, but we <hi>Apoſtles. We</hi> is extenſive; All offend <hi>in many things.</hi> 'Tis implyed in the Lord's Prayer, the daily ſtanding Pattern. As we are to pray for our daily bread, ſo for a daily pardon, and againſt daily temptations, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth our being ſubject to the one, and our commiſſion of the other. The brighteſt Sun hath its ſpots; the cleareſt Moon her dark parts. The Church in her higheſt comelineſs in this world hath her blackneſs of ſin, as well as of affliction; becauſe, though ſin be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted from its Throne by grace, it is not expelled out of its reſidence: It <hi>dwells</hi> in us, though it doth not rule over us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. And it cannot but manifeſt it ſelf by its fruits while it remains. Yet thoſe ſins do not deſtroy our Adoption. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Sermon on the <hi>Mount</hi> to his Diſciples, ſuppoſeth the inherency of ſin, with the continuance of the relation of Children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. <hi>If then you being evil know how to give good gifts to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> He doth acknowledge them evil while he calls God their Father, and gives them the title of Children. To ſin is to decline from that rectitude in an act, which the Agent ought to obſerve. In this reſpect we ſin, according to the tenour of the Law, in every thing we do, though not according to the tenour of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A regenerate man cannot live in the cuſtomary practice of any known ſin, either of omiſſion, or commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not in a conſtant omiſſion of known duties.</hi> If a good man falls into a groſs ſin, he doth not totally omit the performance of common duties to God: Not that this attendance on God in his Ordinances doth of it ſelf argue a man to be a good man; for many that walk in a conſtant courſe of ſin, may from natural Conſcience and Education be as conſtant in the performing external ſervices as he is. 'Tis a proper note of an Hypocrite, that he will not <hi>always</hi> delight himſelf in the Almighty, nor <hi>always</hi> call upon God, <hi>Job</hi> 27.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> not cuſtomarily: Whence it follows, that a delight in God in duties of Worſhip, is a property of a regenerate man. An act of ſin may impair his livelineſs in them, but not cauſe him wholly to omit them. We need not queſtion but <hi>David,</hi> in the time of his impenitency, did go to the Tabernacle, attend upon the Worſhip of God: 'Tis not likely that for <hi>ten months</hi> together he ſhould wholly omit it, though no doubt but he was dead-hearted in it, which is intimated when he deſires a <hi>free ſpirit, Pſ.</hi> 51. &amp; prayes for <hi>quickening, Pſa.</hi> 143.11. one
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41445:47"/> of his Penitential Pſalms. A total neglect of Ordinances and Duties, is a ſhrewd ſign of a total Apoſtacy, and that grace was never in ſuch a mans heart; eſpecially a total omiſſion of prayer; this is an high contempt of God, denying him to be the Author of our mercies, depriving him of the prerogative of governing the world, diſowning any need of him, any ſufficiency in him, declaring we can be our own Gods, and ſubſiſt of our ſelves without him, and that there is no need of his bleſſing. Grace, though ſunk under a ſin, will more or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire its proper nouriſhment, the Milk of the Word, and other Inſtitutions of God. Nature, though oppreſt by a diſeaſe, will require food to keep it alive. A good man in this caſe is like the Planets, which though they be turned about daily from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> by the motion of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> yet they ſtill keep up their proper motion from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> either ſlower or quicker.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not in a cuſtomary commiſſion of any known ſin.</hi> To <hi>work iniquity,</hi> is the proper character of natural men, hence called <hi>workers of iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> And by the ſame title are they called by Chriſt at the Day of Judgment; <hi>Depart from me all you workers of iniquity,</hi> that contrive, lay the plat-form of it, and work at it as at a Trade, or as a curious piece of Art. 'Tis one thing to ſin, another to commit or do a ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 3. <hi>They do not iniquity, they walk in his ways;</hi> their uſual, conſtant courſe is in the way of God; they <hi>do not iniquity,</hi> they ſettle not to it, take not pleaſure in it as their work and way of livelihood. So it is the character of an ungodly man to <hi>walk</hi> in the ways of ſin. <hi>Walking according to the courſe of the world,</hi> and <hi>fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh,</hi> are one and the ſame thing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3. A good man may ſtep into a way of ſin, but he <hi>walks not</hi> in it, to make it either his buſineſs or recreation. So walking in ſin, and living in ſin, are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: What is called <hi>walking after the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.1. is called <hi>living after the fleſh, v.</hi> 13. which is the ſame with committing ſin in the <hi>Text:</hi> So <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>doings</hi> are joyned together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.6. To make ſin our way or walk, is when a man chuſes it as a particular trade and way of living. A good man in ſin is out of his way; a wicked man in ſin is in his way; a good man will not have ſo much as one way of ſin, a wicked hath many ways, for he ſeeks out many inventions. Not one Example of the groſs fall of a good man in Scripture will countenance any pretence for a courſe in ſin; for either they were not in a <hi>courſe</hi> of ſin, or it was not a courſe of known ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk but once, yet that was not a ſin of the ſame hue with that among us. He firſt found out the fruits of the <hi>Vine, Gen.</hi> 9.20. knew nothing of the ſtrength of the Grape, and therefore might eaſily be overcome by an unuſual liquor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt was but twice, and that unwillingly: He knew not his Daughters lying down, or riſing neither time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.33, 35. And for his Daughters, ſome think that they thought there was no man left upon the Earth but their Father, but that is not clear; for <hi>Lot</hi> had been in <hi>Zoar,</hi> and departed thence to the Mountain where their fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. His drunkenneſs admits of ſome aggravations; it was no fit ſeaſon for him to ſwill after ſo ſharp a Judgment upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſo ſevere a remark of God upon his Wife, and ſo great a deliverance to himſelf: Yet this was not a <hi>courſe</hi> of ſin; you read no more of it. There is difference between a mans being drunk, and being a drunkard, the one notes the act, the other the habit and love of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, yet but three times together; not three times with conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals for a full deliberation. 'Tis probable <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith was ſo ſtupified (as well as the Faith of thoſe Diſciples that were going to <hi>Emmaus, Luke</hi> 24.21. <hi>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed</hi> Iſrael; who (and indeed all the Diſciples in ſeveral paſſages) ſeem'd to expect a temporal Kingdom to be erected by him) as therefore not to judge it fit to hazard himſelf for a perſon he thought himſelf ſo much miſtaken in. Howſoever it was, it was not a <hi>courſe</hi> of ſin, and his Repentance over-rules the plea for any cuſtomary tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were charged with Fornication, and eating things ſacrificed to Idols, yet it ſeems to be out of a corrupt Judgment, as appears by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> diſputing againſt the one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15. and againſt the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. And that neither of thoſe were generally judged to be ſins by the converted Gentiles, as appears by the Decree of the <hi>Apoſtles, Acts</hi> 15.28, 29. where they determine againſt both theſe; though this was a courſe of ſin, yet not a courſe of known ſins; and after they were informed by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the ſinfulneſs of them, they abſtain'd: therefore in the <hi>ſecond Epiſtle</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt Epiſtle was writ the 25th year after the death of Chriſt, and 2d Epiſtle the 26th year according to <hi>Baronias.</hi>
               </note> writ the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to them, he charges them not with thoſe former crimes, but comforts them for their being ſo much caſt down with ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi>'s ſin, though lying upon him for about <hi>ten or twelve months,</hi> yet it was not a <hi>courſe</hi> of ſin; and we find a ſignal Repentance afterwards; but of that after. To walk in a road of known ſins is the next ſtep to committing ſin as ſin, and manifeſts the habit of ſin to have a ſtrong and fixed dominion in the will.</p>
            <p>I ſhall confirm this by ſome <hi>Reaſons,</hi> becauſe upon this <hi>Propoſition</hi> depend all the following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Regeneration gives not a man a diſpenſation from the Law of God.</hi> As Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law, but to eſtabliſh it, ſo grace doth not diſpenſe with the Law, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Authority of it. Habitual grace is not given us to aſſiſt us in the breaches of it, but to enable us to the performance of it. As the grace of God which hath appeared to all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41445:47"/> men teaches the Doctrine of Holineſs, ſo the grace of God <hi>in us</hi> enables us to walk in the way of holineſs. Grace <hi>in</hi> a Believer embraceth what the grace of God teaches. The Moral Laws of God are indiſpenſable in themſelves, and of eternal verity. Therefore as no rational creature, much leſs can a regenerate perſon be exempted from that obedience to the Law, which as a rational creature he is bound to obſerve. The grace of God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is never conferred without grace ſanctifying: 'Tis certain, where Chriſt is made <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> he is made <hi>ſanctification.</hi> 'Tis not congruous to the Divine Holineſs, to look upon a perſon as righteous, who hath not a renewed principle in him, no more than it is congruous to the Divine Juſtice and Holineſs, to look upon him as righteous, meerly for this principle ſo imperfect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis not for the honour of God to ſuffer a cuſtom and courſe of ſin in a renewed man.</hi> 'Tis true, a renewed man ſhould not voluntarily, nor doth commit willingly even ſins of lighter infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but God ſuffers thoſe, becauſe they do not wound the honour of Chriſtianity, though they diſcover a remoteneſs from a ſtate of perfection. But they do not cuſtomarily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great ſins, for it ſeems not congruous to permit ſuch courſes commonly in any one which would diſgrace Religion, and make that deſpicable in the eyes of the world, which God hath deſigned in all Ages to honour. Since he hath delivered his Son to death, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the honour of his Law; it ſeems not to conſiſt with his wiſdom, to let thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fruits of his death, walk in a cuſtomary contempt of his Law. Neither can we think that God would permit that in a Believer, which is againſt the very eſſence of grace, though he may permit that which is againſt the beauty and accidental perfection of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of the Covenant.</hi> In the Covenant we are to take God for <hi>our God, i. e.</hi> for our chief good, and laſt end. But a courſe of ſin is an adoration of the ſinful Object as the chief good, and laſt end, becauſe a man prefers the creature before God, and loves it ſupremely, contrary to the will of God. 'Tis eſſential for one in Covenant with God, to have an high valuation of God and his will. But a cuſtom of known ſins evidenceth that there is not a worthy and practical eſteem of God. How can any condition of the covenant conſiſt with a conſtant practice of ſin? How can there be <hi>faith</hi> where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is not believed? How can there be <hi>love</hi> if the pleaſure of God be not regarded? How can there be <hi>fear</hi> if his authority be wilfully contemned? How can there be a <hi>new heart</hi> when there is nothing but an old frame, and a diabolical nature. 'Tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing thoſe conditions upon which a right to heaven is founded. For a worker of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty walks in thoſe ways which are prohibited upon pain of not entring into that place of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo doth wilfully refuſe the acceptance of the conditions on Gods part, and the performance of the conditions on his own part, which are neceſſary to Gods glory, and his own intereſt. 'Tis an invaſion of Gods right whereby he refuſeth God for his God and Lord, and ſets up himſelf as his own governour, an affecting vertually an equality with God, and independency on him, which in the common nature of ſin is vertually the ſame with that of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who ſinned from the beginning, and therefore a courſe in ſin, one that is born of God doth not continue in. Perhaps the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> might have ſome ſuch reſpect upon his oppoſing the Believers not committing ſin to the ſin of the <hi>Devil</hi> from the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a courſe of ſin whereby a Man declares as the Devil did, that he will be his own governour, as indeed in every courſe of ſin a Man doth practically declare.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of our firſt repentance and converſion to God.</hi> True repentance is <hi>a breaking off iniquity by righteouſneſs, Dan.</hi> 4.27. a turning from ſin to holineſs, from our ſelves to God, from our own Wills to the Will of God; from every thing elſe as the chief good, and laſt end, to God as both theſe. Now though a particular act of ſin be againſt the watchfulneſs which attends repentance, yet a courſe of ſin is againſt the nature of it,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Taylor</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>pag.</hi> 188.</note> the one is againſt the livelineſs of Repentance, the other againſt the life of it. A delightful walking in any known ſin, though never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is a defyance to God, and therefore contrary to the nature of converſion, and is a vertual embracing of <hi>all ſin</hi> whatſoever; becauſe he that in his ordinary walk in ſin hath no reſpect to the Will and pleaſure of God, though he knows it, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from his delight by any ſuch regard of God, would be reſtrain'd from no other ſin whatſoever, if he did conceive them as pleaſant, advantageous, and ſuitable to him as he doth that which is his darling. As he that <hi>breaks one point of the Law is guilty of all, James</hi> 2.10. becauſe he ſhews thereby a Will and Diſpoſition to break all, if the ſame occaſions were offer'd. So he that commits one known ſin wilfully, much more he that walks in a courſe of ſin, is guilty of all ſins vertually. For he would boggle at no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon a reſpect to God, becauſe if a regard to God doth not prevail upon him againſt a courſe in one kind, it will not detain him from a courſe in all other kinds of ſin, if he come under the ſame circumſtances for it. Let me add this too, If he that offends in <hi>one</hi> point of the Law be guilty of <hi>all, i. e.</hi> as much delight and eagerneſs, as he hath in the breach of that one, it is to be ſuppoſed that he would have in the breach of all the reſt upon the former reaſon, can then ſuch a diſpoſition which is in every courſe of known ſin, be conſiſtent with the nature of repentance and converſion?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of habitual grace, which is the principle and form of our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If he doth not commit ſin becauſe the ſeed of God remains in him, then ſuch a courſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41445:48"/> of ſin is againſt the nature of this ſeed; inconſiſtent with the birth of God; a crooked and perverſe Spirit in ſin is a ſign of a putrified Soul, a <hi>ſpot</hi> of a different nature from that of <hi>Gods Children;</hi> Deut. 32.5. <hi>They have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are a perverſe and crooked Generation;</hi> 'tis a ſtain peculiar to the Children of the <hi>Devil,</hi> not the Sons of God. A Trade in ſin is an evidence of a Diabolical Nature, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that commits ſin is of the Devil.</hi> 'Tis not therefore conſiſtent with grace, which is a Divine Nature. The reign of ſin is inconſiſtent with the reign of grace, though the rebellion of ſin be not. 'Tis againſt the nature of Regeneration for ſin to guide our Wills, though it be not againſt the nature of it, for ſin to reſide in our fleſh. To <hi>walk after the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.1. is an inſeparable Character of a natural Man. The <hi>Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> had been complaining of the <hi>Law of his Members,</hi> the ſerving ſin with his Fleſh, he comforts himſelf with this, that he obeyed it not; and that they were in Chriſt, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary walk was as the Spirit led, not as the Fleſh allured.<note n="*" place="margin">Amyrant. <hi>in</hi> Joh. 8.9.</note> And indeed <hi>every Tree</hi> brings forth fruit ſuitable to its nature. A Vine brings not forth Thorns; and he that hath the ſeed of God, is under an impoſſibility of bringing forth the fruits of ſin with delight, ſince he hath a Root of righteouſneſs planted in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of a renewed underſtanding.</hi> A Regenerate Man hath a new light in his mind, whereby he hath a fairer proſpect of God, and a fouler of ſin. He was an <hi>enemy</hi> to God <hi>in his mind</hi> before, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. He had diſhonourable opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of God and goodneſs, and honourable thoughts of ſin above its merit, he thought ill of the one and well of the other. But now he is <hi>renewed in the Spirit of his mind, Eph.</hi> 4.23. and he hath the <hi>Spirit of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. His judgment is regulated by the Law of God, he judges of ſin as it is in its nature a tranſgreſſion of the Law. Can we imagine, that a Man reſtored to a ſound mind, and that hath his natural madneſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, ſhould act after this cure as much out of his wits as before. If he hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant frenzies and madneſs as much as before, where is his cure.? Can any Man in the world act always againſt his judgment? though he may be overpowered by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of others, or over-ruled by a fit of paſſion to do ſomething againſt his judgment; can you expect always to find him in the road of croſſing the dictates of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? An unregenerate Man hath a natural light in his Mind and Conſcience, and ſo a judgment of ſin; but he hath not a judgment of ſin adequate to the object, he doth not judge of ſin in the whole latitude of it; he hath not a ſettled judgment of the contrariety of his beloved ſin to God. He looks not upon it in the extent of it, as, <hi>malum injucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, inhoneſtum, inutile;</hi> if he looks upon ſin as diſhoneſt, he regards it as profitable; if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as honeſt or profitable, yet as pleaſant; ſo that the natural light, which is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding when it dictates right, is mated and over-ruled by ſome other principle, the pleaſure or profit of it, and ſwayed by the inherent habits of ſin in the Will. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> that works in them hath ſome principle to ſtir up, or dim this natural light, and caſt a miſt before the Eye; and ſo they direct their courſe according to that particular judgment which is befriended in its vote by ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of a renewed Will.</hi> Grace is the law of God in the heart, and is put in to inable us to walk in the ways of God; and ſhall it endure ſuch wilful pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Creature, when it is the end of its being there to preſerve from them? The <hi>Spirit</hi> is given in <hi>the Heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. ſent into the Heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. the <hi>Law</hi> put into <hi>the Heart, Heb.</hi> 10.16. Since therefore there is an habit of grace in the <hi>Will,</hi> a Man cannot frequently and eaſily lanch into ſin, becauſe he cannot do it habitually, the remainders of ſin being mated with a powerful habit, which watches their motions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them. Doth God put ſuch a habit there, ſuch a <hi>ſeed,</hi> an <hi>abiding ſeed</hi> to no purpoſe, but to let the Soul be wounded by every temptation, to be deſerted in every time of need? Grace is an habit ſuperadded to that natural and moral ſtrengrh which is in the Will. Man by natures ſtrength meerly, or with the aſſiſtance of common grace, hath power to avoid the acts of groſs ſins, for he is maſter of his own actions, though he is not of the motions tending to them; the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot force a Mans Will. And when grace a greater ſtrength comes in, ſhall there be no effects of this ſtrength, but the reins be as ſtiff in the hands of old luſt, and the Will as much captive to the ſinful habit in it as before? Grace being a new nature, it is as abſurd to think that a gracious man ſhould wallow in a courſe of ſin, as it is to think that any creature ſhould conſtantly and willingly do that which is againſt its nature. A gracious man <hi>delights in the Law of God,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night;</hi> if he delights in it, can he delight to break it? Do Men fling that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, every day in the Durt, and trample upon it, or rather do they not keep it choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Cabinets? If it be alſo the Character of a good man to <hi>meditate in the Law</hi> of God, he muſt have frequent exerciſes of faith, reflections upon himſelf, motions to God which cannot conſiſt with a courſe of ſin Grace doth eſſentially include a contrariety to ſin, and a love to God in the Will. 'Tis a principle of doing good and eſchewing evil, and theſe being eſſential properties of grace, are eſſential to every regenerate man, and in every one. As a drop of Water, or one ſpark of Fire hath the eſſential properties of a great maſs of Water, or a great quantity of Fire; ſo every renewed man hath the ſame love
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41445:48"/> to God, and the ſame hatred of ſin eſſentially, as the moſt eminent Saint, though not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yea which thoſe in heaven have, though not in the ſame degree. As a ſpark of fire will burn, a drop of water will moiſten, though not in ſo eminent a meaſure. Now, upon the whole conſider whether is it poſſible to bare reaſon, that a regenerate man ſhould cuſtomarily do thoſe things which are againſt the eſſential properties of that which is in him, in his will, and doth denominate him a new Creature?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Propoſition. <hi>A regenerate man cannot have a fixt reſolution to walk in ſuch a way of ſin, were the impediments to it removed.</hi> Though unregenerate men may actually as to the outward exerciſe abſtain from ſome ſins, yet it is uſually upon low and mean conditions. If it were not for ſuch or ſuch an obſtacle in the way I would do ſuch and ſuch an act. This temper is not in a good man, he cannot have a fixed and determinate reſolution to commit ſuch an act, if ſuch bars were taken away. Such reſolutions are Common in unregenerate men; <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.25. <hi>We will ſurely perform our vows which we have vow'd to burn incenſe to the Queen of Heaven,</hi> and Iſa. 56.12. <hi>We will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant;</hi> we will have as merry a meeting as we had to day. The ſame character is aſcribed to ſuch an one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>He deviſeth miſchief upon his bed. He ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a way that is not good. He ahhorreth not evil.</hi> He modells out his ſinful deſigns with head and heart, he ſettles himſelf as an army ſettles in their ground when they reſolve to fight, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>He abhors not evil.</hi> He ſtarts not at ſuch motions, but by a <hi>Meioſis,</hi> he huggs and careſſeth them with a wonderful delight. <hi>Regenerate</hi> men fear to ſin, <hi>wicked</hi> men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to ſin. <hi>One</hi> would ſtarve it, the <hi>other</hi> makes proviſion for it. This temper cannot be in a Regenerate man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis Diabolical.</hi> And ſo falls under that in the <hi>text,</hi> He cannot Commit ſin as the <hi>Devil</hi> doth. 'Tis a ſtain of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is reſolved in his way of malice to God, and miſchief to man, but for the ſtrait Chains God holds him in; his reſolution is fixed, though the execution reſtrained. <hi>He goes about ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to drink at one draught:</hi> Seeking both for an opportunity and permiſſion. Unwearied ſearches mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt fixed reſolutions. His throat is ready to ſwallow, if he had a morſel for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis a ſign of habitual ſin, a ſtate of ſin.</hi> This temper manifeſts that the will is habituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſin, though the hand doth not outwardly act it. The inherent power of ſin muſt be great, when a man is greedy to commit that, to which he hath no outward allurements, or when thoſe allurements are ballanced with contrary conſiderations; when he hath either no outward temptation to it, or the croſs impediments are as ſtrong, or ſtronger than the temptation. When men in the midſt of ſuch bars long for a temptation, it is ſuch a kind of deſire in one way, as the <hi>Creature</hi> hath in an other, for the manifeſtation of the the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the Creature waits for the manifeſtation,</hi> 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a putting out the head to ſee if he can find any coming to knock off the fetters, not of his ſin, but of his forced morality. In this caſe take <hi>two</hi> men, <hi>one</hi> Commits a great ſin upon a temptation even as it were over-power'd by it, and had no thoughts, no inclinations before that temptation appear'd, which began firſt to ſpirit him. <hi>Another</hi> Commits a lighter ſin, or would fain Commit it upon a weak temptation, and many bars lying in the way, and his heart was hankering and thirſting for ſome opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Commit it: which do you think really is the greater offence in point of heart and affection? The firſt appears blacker, but it is an invaſion; the other is really blacker becauſe it is an affection, and ſhews ſin to be rooted in the heart as its proper ſoil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſin delights to grow, and the ſoil delights to nouriſh it. The one ſhews ſin to be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a thief, which hath waylaid him, the other evidenceth ſin to be an inmate and intimate friend. Such a man is not oblig'd to his will for his abſtinence from ſin, but to the outward hindrances; and the reſolving act of the will to Commit it, were thoſe impediments remov'd, is as real an act of ſin in the ſight of God as any outward act can be in the ſight of man, becauſe God meaſures the greatneſs of ſin by the proportion of the will allowed to it; therefore many ſins which may be little in our account may be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Gods account, than the ſeemingly blacker ſins of others, becauſe there may be a greater ingrediency of the heart and affection in them than in the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of our repentance and firſt cloſing with God.</hi> Repentance is a change of the purpoſe of the heart, not to Commit the ſame iniquity again, nor any other, <hi>Job.</hi> 34.32. <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> 'Tis the property of converting grace to make the Soul <hi>cleave to the Lord with</hi> full <hi>purpoſe of heart,</hi> Act. 11.23. This is eſſential to it, though there may be ſome ſtartings out by paſſion and temptation. A Pilots intention ſtands right for the port, though by the violence of the wind he may be forced another way. It alters not his purpoſe, though it defer his performance. This purpoſe is a perpetual intent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>v. I have inclined my heart to keep thy ſtatutes alway even to the end.</hi> It was an heart-purpoſe and inclination; It regarded all Gods ſtatutes, not for a fit, but perpetually, which he manifeſts by <hi>two</hi> words <hi>[alwaies even to the end]</hi> to ſhew that the perpetuity of it doth difference it from the reſolutions of wicked men, who may indeed have ſome fits to do good, but not a fixed purpoſe to cleave to the Lord; theſe flaſhy purpoſes are like the flight of a bird which ſeems to touch Heaven, and in a moment falls down to the earth; as <hi>Saul</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to perſecute <hi>David,</hi> but we ſoon find him again upon his old game &amp; purſuit. Where
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41445:49"/> there is true grace, there is hatred of all ſin, for hatred is <gap reason="foreign">

As this inward purpoſe of a good man is againſt all ſin, ſo more particularly againſt that which doth ſo <hi>eaſily beſet him. David</hi> ſeems in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places to be naturally inclind to <hi>lying,</hi> but he takes up a particular reſolution againſt it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.3. <hi>I am purpoſed that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi>

               <hi>I have contrived</hi> to way-lay and intercept the ſin of lying when it hath an occaſion to approach me. A good man hath not only purpoſes, but he endeavours to faſten and ſtrengthen thoſe purpoſes by prayer. So <hi>David,</hi> v. 5. [<hi>hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footſteps ſlip not.</hi> He ſtrengthens <hi>himſelf by ſtirring up a livelineſs</hi> in duty, and by avoiding occaſions of ſin, v. 4. [<hi>I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer.</hi> Whereas a wicked man neither ſteps out of the way of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor ſteps up to God for ſtrength againſt it. Now if all this be true, that in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the heart hath a fixed reſolution for God and his ways, and that perpetually, againſt all ſin, and particularly againſt the ſin of our natural inclination, and all this backt with ſtrong cries, how can it have a fixed reſolution to Commit it, if the way were outwardly fair for it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis abſolutely againſt the terms of the Covenant.</hi> God requires in that a giving up our ſelves to him, to be his people with our whole heart and Soul, as he gives himſelf to us with his whole heart. He will not be a Sharer of the heart with ſin, much leſs an underling to it. God will not indure a competitor in the affections. To <hi>ſerve God and mammon</hi> are inconſiſtent by the infallible <hi>Axiom</hi> of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.13. Now, as God cannot be true to his Covenant, if he had purpoſes againſt the articles of it on his part, ſo neither can we be true to our covenanting with him, if we have ſetled purpoſes of heart againſt the Conditions of it. Therefore the inſtability in the Covenant ariſeth only from the falſeneſs of the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37. <hi>Their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> The iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our heels may compaſs us about, and make us ſtumble in our walk, yet our fears of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with God may receive no eſtabliſhment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Wherefore ſhould I fear, when the iniquity of my heels ſhall compaſs me about?</hi> Whether he means by iniquity the ſins of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary walk, or the puniſhment of them, is all one. But yet if purpoſes of iniquity ſettle their reſidence in the heart, though we never act it by reaſon of obſtacles, 'tis a ſign we never ſincerely cloſed with God in Covenant, nor God with us. The very <hi>regards of iniquity in the heart</hi> put a bar to the regards of God towards us. It hinders all Covenant acts on Gods part, becauſe it is a manifeſt breach of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis againſt the nature of Regeneration.</hi> Regeneration is a change of nature and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of reſolutions. A <hi>Lyon</hi> chained up hath an inclination to ravage, but a Lyon chang'd into the nature of a <hi>Lamb</hi> loſes his inclinations, with that change of his nature; ſo that it is as impoſſible a regenerate man can have the fixed and determinate reſolutions that a wicked man hath, as it is impoſſible that a Lamb ſhould have the ravenous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a Lyon; you know the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes the change as great. How can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do a thing againſt that law, which at the ſame time, he hath an habitual approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of as <hi>holy, juſt and good?</hi> Againſt a law natural to him, <hi>viz.</hi> The law of the heart. If a delight in the Law of God be a conſtitutive part of Regeneration, then any ſettled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſin is inconſiſtent with Regeneration, becauſe ſuch a purpoſe, being a teſtimony of an inward delight in that which is contrary to the Law of God, cannot conſiſt with a delight in that which forbids what his heart is ſet upon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Propoſition. <hi>A regenerate man cannot walk in a way doubtful to him without inquiries, whether it be a way of ſin, or a way of duty, and without admitting of reproofs and admonitions according to his circumſtances.</hi> This conſiſts of <hi>two parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He cannot walk in a way doubtful to him without inquiries, whether it be a way of ſin, or of duty.</hi> If the nature of converſion be an <hi>inclination</hi> of the heart to keep Gods ſtatutes always, even <hi>to the end, Pſal.</hi> 119.112. the natural reſult then will be an enquiry what are the ſtatutes of God which the Soul is to keep. A natural man, for fear of being diſturbed in his ſinful pleaſure refuſeth to underſtand the way of the Lord, and delights to be under the power of a willful darkneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 21.14, 15. <hi>We deſire not the knowledge of thy ways; what is the almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have, if we pray to him?</hi> This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to know the ways of God ariſes from a contempt of the Almighty and his ſervice. They judged it not profitable to ſerve and worſhip God, and therefore were loth to receive any inſtruction, for fear any light ſhould ſpring up in them, by way of conviction, to diſturb them. Men love ſin, and therefore hate any knowledge which may deprive them of the ſweetneſs of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1 22. <hi>The Scorners delight in their ſcorning and fools hate knowledg.</hi> They delight in ſin, and therefore hate any knowledg which may check their delight. And this unwillingneſs to <hi>chooſe the fear of the Lord</hi> is the ground of their hating the knowledg of it, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>for that they hated knowledge and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord.</hi> They are afraid to be convinced that the way of their delight is a way of ſin, they would have no gall in their Conſcience to imbitter the hony of their luſts. This hatred of knowledg is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with true converſion, becauſe converſion is an election or choice of the fear of God, and therefore cannot reſiſt any means tending to promote that which is choſen. 'Tis eſſential to true grace to inquire into the mind and will of God, to underſtand what is pleaſing to him, <hi>Job.</hi> 34.32. <hi>That which I ſee not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity I will
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41445:49"/> do no more.</hi> Inform me in what I know not, &amp; if I underſtand it is iniquity, which I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorantly in, I will do it no more. He will not <hi>return to folly</hi> when he ſhall <hi>hear what God the Lord ſhall ſpeak.</hi> 'Tis certainly incompatible to the new nature to act in a contrariety to God. Grace is always attended with an univerſal deſire to know his will, and pleaſure him in performing it; hence will follow an inquiry, what behaviour and what acts are moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him? <hi>John.</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keeps them, he it is that Loves me.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> is; He that hath no mind to have my Commandments, becauſe he would not keep them, hath no love to me. <hi>He it is [Emphatically,]</hi> excluſively, that is the man, and none elſe that Loves me. Now if a man be afraid of making inquiry into the lawfulneſs of a courſe he is wedded to, for fear his beloved object ſhould appear to be a ſin, 'tis a ſign he abſtains from what he knows certainly to be a ſin out of a ſervile fear, not out of a generous, Divine Love, a Principle as eſſential to the new nature, as fear is to an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned carnaliſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Regenerate man cannot deſpiſe admonitions and reproofs, which would inform him and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from a ſinful courſe.</hi> If he be in the way of life that keeps inſtruction, then he that refuſeth reproof is in the way of death, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.17. <hi>He is in the way of life that keeps inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he that refuſeth reproof erreth.</hi> 'Tis put in a milder expreſſion, but if you obſerve the <hi>oppoſition,</hi> it amounts to the inference I make. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>The Lord Loves them that follow after Righteouſneſs; correction is grievous unto them that forſake the way, and he that hates reproof ſhall dye.</hi> Here is a plain <hi>oppoſition</hi> made between them that follow after Righteouſneſs, which is the character of a regenerate man, who is therefore the object of Gods Love, and that perſon that accounts correction grievous and hates reproof, he is not one that follows after Righteouſneſs (to purſue is to embrace it) and therefore not the object of Gods Love, but the mark of death. So that it is impoſſible a righteous man ſhould hate reproof. Nay the hating of reproof, whereby a man might be informed of his duty, is a ſign not of a bare unregeneracy, but of one at the very bottom of it, wallowing in the very dreggs and mud of it fartheſt from the Kingdom of Heaven; one that ſcarce looks like a rational creature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.1. <hi>whoſo Loves inſtruction Loves knowledge, but he that hates reproof is brutiſh.</hi> Whereas <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſe man, which is a Regenerate man, will love the reprover for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs ſake, and grow wiſer by inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8, 9. <hi>Reprove not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee; rebuke a wiſe man and he will Love thee, give inſtruction to a wiſe man, and he will be yet wiſer, teach a juſt man, and he will encreaſe in learning.</hi> Juſt men change their intentions upon a diſcovery of the ſinfulneſs of their way. And though it may not at the firſt aſſault of an admonition appear to be a ſin, yet it will check ſomewhat their violence in it. But where ſin hath a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, every check and diſcovery of it doth rather enflame than quench it, and the heart like a ſtream riſes the higher for the damm. <hi>Judas</hi> had an admonition from Chriſt that informed him of what wickedneſs he was about, and the danger of it, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.21. He pronounceth a wo againſt him. Compare this with <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.27, 30. when he gives him the <hi>ſop,</hi> which was at the ſame time he informed him of the danger, <hi>Satan</hi> entered into him, and he went more roundly to work to accompliſh it, <hi>he went immediately out. Obſerve</hi> by the way, That the Spirit of God enters into a mans heart often upon admonitions from friends, and the <hi>Devil</hi> alſo more powerfully upon the ſame occaſions than at other times. A good man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not habitually hate the reprover. There is one example of a good man dealing hardly with a <hi>Prophet,</hi> for reproving him in the <hi>name of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Then</hi> Aſa <hi>was wroth with the Seer, and put him into a Priſon houſe; for he was in a rage with him, becauſe of this thing.</hi> And partly for the Judgment of war againſt him. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives an allay to it; <hi>For he was in a rage.</hi> He was in a paſſion, becauſe of the threatning and the plainneſs of the ſpeech, <hi>thou haſt done fooliſhly.</hi> To ſay ſuch a word to an inferior would ordinarily now a days ſwell many a profeſſor to a fury, much more a Prince. This very <hi>Propoſition</hi> will diſcover, that there are many more pretenders to a Regenerate ſtate than poſſeſſors of it, ſo ſtrangely is not only Humane Nature, but the Chriſtian Religion depraved among us.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Propoſ. <hi>A regenerate man cannot have a ſettled, deliberate love to any one act of ſin, though he may fall into it.</hi> Thus the Devil ſins, he loves what he doth. Though a good man may fall into a ſin, &amp; even ſuch a ſin, which he was much guilty of before his Converſion and which he hath repented of, yet never into a love of it, or the allowance of any one act of it. For by Regeneration the Soul becomes like God in diſpoſition, and therefore cannot love any thing which he hates, whoſe hatred and love being always juſt, are unerring Rules to the love and hatred of every one of his Children. He can never account a ſin his ornament, but his fetter, never his delight, but his grief. I add this <hi>Propoſition,</hi> becauſe there may be a love of an act of ſin, where there is not a conſtant courſe in it: As a man that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a murther out of revenge, may love afterwards the very thoughts of that revenge, though he never murther any more: And a man that hath committed an act of Adultery, may review it with pleaſure, though he never commit an act again. But a good man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. <hi>David</hi> is ſuppoſed to be inclined to the way of lying and diſſembling; though he might falter ſometimes, and look that way, and perhaps fall into it, yet never into a love of it; therefore <hi>obſerve, Pſal.</hi> 119.163. <hi>I hate and abhor lying; but thy Law do I love.</hi> A ſingle hatred would not ſerve the turn; but, <hi>I hate and abhor.</hi> I have not the leaſt affection to this of any, though I have the greateſt natural inclination to it. What was the reaſon?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41445:50"/> 
               <hi>Thy Law do I love.</hi> There was another affection planted in his Soul, which could not conſiſt with a love to, or allowance either of the <hi>habit,</hi> or any one <hi>act</hi> of lying. A good man hath yielded his Soul up to the government of Chriſt, his affections are fully engaged; he cannot ſee an equal amiableneſs in any other Object, for he cannot loſe his Eyes again; his enlightened mind cannot be wholly blinded and deceived by <hi>Satan;</hi> he walks not by the inveiglements of ſenſe, but by the unerring Rule of Faith; ſo that though by ſome miſts before his Eyes, he may for a while be deluded, yet as he cannot have a ſetled falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo he cannot have a ſetled affection to any one act of ſin. 'Tis <hi>one</hi> thing for a <hi>City</hi> to ſurrender it ſelf to the Enemy out of affection, and <hi>another</hi> thing to be forced by them: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a force they may retain their Loyalty to their lawful Prince. There may be ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate approbations of an act of ſin. <hi>Jonah</hi> was an Advocate for his own paſſion againſt God, and made a very peremptory Apology for it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.9. <hi>I do well to be angry, even to the death.</hi> Yet if we may judge by his former temper, we cannot think he did afterwards defend it out of judgment, as he did then out of paſſion; for when the Lot fell upon him, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.9, 12. he made no defence for his ſin, he very calmly wiſhes them to caſt him into the Sea. Where there is a paſſionate approbation, it cannot be conſtant in a good man; for when he returns to himſelf, his abhorrences of the ſin and of himſelf for it, are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if by the greatneſs of his grief he would endeavour to make ſome recompence for the folly of his paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve</hi> by the way; <hi>A good man may commit a ſin with much eagerneſs, and yet have a leſs affection to it in the very act, than another,</hi> who acts that ſin more calmly; becauſe it may ariſe, not from any particular inclination he hath in his temper to that ſin, but from the general violence of his natural temper, which is common to him in that action. This ſeems to be the caſe of <hi>Jonah</hi> both in this, and the former act. But if a man be more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in that act of ſin, than he is in other things by his natural temper, there is ground both for himſelf and others to think, that ſin hath got a great maſtery over his affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to be a man of great affections, and of a forward natural temper; he was very haſty to have Tabernacles built in the Mountain for his <hi>Maſter, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and have reſided there. He haſtily rebukes his Maſter; he flung himſelf out of a Ship to meet our Saviour walking upon the water, and after his Reſurrection he leapt into the Sea to get to him: So that <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying his Maſter was not ſuch an evidence of diſaffection to him, or love to the ſinful act he was then ſurpriz'd by, as it would have been in <hi>John,</hi> or any other Diſciple of a more ſedate temper. But this only by the way, as a <hi>Rule</hi> both to judg your ſelves by, and to moderate your Cenſures of others. And conſider, That ſuch acts of ſin are not frequent. The violence of a mans temper, if godly, cannot carry him out into a courſe of ſin, or a love to any one act. As a wicked man may hit upon a good duty, and perform it, but not out of a ſettled love to God, or habitual obedience to his Law; ſo a good man may by ſurprize do an evil work, not out of obedience to the Law of ſin, or any love to the ſin it ſelf. What conſiderations may move a wicked man to a good duty, may in ſome reſpect move a good man to a ſinful act; yet it is not to be called a duty in the one, no more than it is to be called a ſin in the other of the ſame hue, of the ſame hue I ſay, with that in a natural man.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Propoſition; <hi>A regenerate man cannot commit any ſin with a full conſent and bent of will.</hi> A man may conſent to that which he doth not love. Hereby I diſtinguiſh it from the former Propoſition. I mean not, that he cannot commit any ſin wilfully as ſin, for ſo I believe no man doth; it being againſt the nature of the creature to do <hi>evil,</hi> as evil <hi>formaliter,</hi> but under ſome other notion of it. Some <hi>conſent</hi> of the will I do acknowledg, becauſe the will as well as the other faculties, is but in part regenerate; as there is not a triumphant light in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo neither is the grace of the will at preſent triumphant, but militant; yet it may be rather called the will of ſin, than a mans own will. Sometimes a good man is by ſome ſudden motion hurried on to ſin, before he can conſult law and reaſon, before he hath his wits well at liberty, before he can compare the temptation or ſin with the prohibition of it by the Divine Law. But generally there is a reſiſtance in him, as well as a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſin; for the <hi>two</hi> contrary principles exert themſelves in ſome meaſure. Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and ſin provokes: Whereas another that hath no grace, ſins with a <hi>full conſent,</hi> becauſe he hath no ſpiritual reſiſting principle in him; for he is fleſh, and not ſpirit, and whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and wholly fleſh. There is a reſiſting indeed in a natural man, but it is a reſiſtance of natural light, not of grace, a reſiſtance not of the <hi>Will,</hi> but of the <hi>Conſcience;</hi> the Will is bent to ſin, but natural Conſcience puts rubs in the way. Neither is this reſiſtance in ſpiritual ſins (which is the greateſt character I know, whereby to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a reſiſtance of natural Conſcience, from a reſiſtance by a principle of grace) which natural Conſcience doth not ſo much trouble it ſelf about, as not having light without a ſpiritual illumination to diſcern them; but only in groſs ſins, ſuch as are condemned by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon; ſo that if he hath any reſiſtance, it is not in the will of the man, but the will of his Intereſt, will of his Credit, or the will of his Conſcience; not in the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will complying with, and delighting in the will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A regenerate man cannot commit any ſin with</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An habitual Conſent;</hi> becauſe he hath a principle of grace within him which oppoſes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41445:50"/> that tide of nature which did forcibly carry him down before. This oppoſite principle doth remain, though the preſent oppoſition may not be diſcerned by reaſon of the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the temptation: As in a Room warm'd by a fire in Winter, there is a principle in the Air doth reſiſt that heat, and reduce it after the fire is out to its former rawneſs and coldneſs. A renewed man being paſſed into another nature, it cannot be ſuppoſed he can do any thing with an habitual bent of will againſt his nature. Grace hath put a ſtop to that. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth himſelf from ſin in the acts of it; <hi>'Tis not I,</hi> or my will, <hi>but ſin, Rom.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwells in me.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies to perfect and compleat a work, to work induſtriouſly and politely. Had I my will, I ſhould not do thus. There is a divorce made between the will and ſin, ſo that ſin acts upon a ſingle ſcore, now, <hi>'Tis no more I;</hi> a divorce is made between my will and ſin. The Law of Sin is therefore called a Law <hi>in</hi> the members, not of the members; a Law found working there, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>I find a Law in my members;</hi> I did not enact it, I placed it not there, I conſent not to its being there; but there I find it, and know not how to be rid of it, but it ſhall never have my will. But the Law of grace is called a Law <hi>of</hi> the mind, not <hi>in</hi> the mind; a Law which is ſettled there by the conſent of the Soul, and to whoſe Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Guidance it yields it ſelf. The Law of ſin is in the members; the vigor of it is ſeen in the inferiour faculties of the Soul, not in the higher, the mind and will; 'tis a Law impoſed upon me, not imbraced by me; a Law of diſturbance, not of obedience; a Law that troubles me, doth not delight me, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. It reſides as an Enemy warring, but hath no intimacy with me as a friend, <hi>v.</hi> 23. yet it is an Enemy driven to the out-works, to the members: So that where all this is, you cannot ſuppoſe an habitual conſent to ſin, when the will is formed into another nature. As the will of the wicked is poſſeſſed by habits of ſin under the reſtraints from it, ſo the will of the godly is poſſeſſed by habits of grace, even under the rape of a prevailing temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor an actual conſent both antecedent and conſequent.</hi> The Intereſt of ſin may ſeem to be actually higher and ſtronger in the Soul than the Intereſt of God, though this latter is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſtronger than the Intereſt of ſin. Though there may be an antecedent delight in the motion, a preſent delight in the action, yet there is not a permanent conſequent delight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; yet the two firſt are rare. 'Tis ſeldom that a renewed Soul and ſin do ſo friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together without any ſpiritual reluctancy. Suppoſe he may have by the ſuſpenſion of grace, a whole actual conſent of will to one particular ſin, upon ſome ſtrong provocation, yet he gives not up himſelf to the will or way of that ſin. He is only under a temporary, not a perpetual power of it. As a man in a fight may by a fall be under the power of his Enemy, yet in the ſtruggle get up again, and reduce him to the ſame neceſſity. Though there be not an expreſs diſſent at the motion, nor in the action, yet there is alwaies after; for it is as much againſt the terms of the Covenant to have a perpetual delight in any ſin committed, as to commit it often, becauſe this delight in it is an approbation of it, and every act of delight, is a new act of approbation, and conſequently a recommiſſion of it, and a making a mans ſelf a perpetual acceſſary to that firſt act.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes he hath an antecedent diſſent.</hi> A renewed man is troubled and diſpleaſed at the firſt motion to a ſin; he is ſometimes troubled that any ſin ſhould ſo much as ask him the queſtion to have entertainment in him: 'Tis ſo many times with a natural man, much more with a regenerate man; yet afterwards that diſplicency abating, the ſin creeps upon him by degrees, and enſnares him. <hi>Paul</hi> had an act of will againſt that which he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did it; he did that which was preceded by an act of his will nilling it, as there was an act of his will, for the doing good preceding his not doing it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do.</hi> The act of his will was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>To will is preſent with me,</hi> I have <hi>that</hi> ſtanding in a readineſs to do good; but the executive power is at a diſtance, I know not how to have it. <hi>But how to perform that which is good I find not.</hi> He ſpeaks as a man that was ſearching for ſomething which he had a great deſire to find, and could not meet with it. Many times a good man is tyred out with the importunity of a temptation, and is fain to fling down his weapons, and ſink under the oppreſſion, till he receive a new recruit of ſtrength by exciting and aſſiſting grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes concomitant,</hi> in the very commiſſion of a ſin. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to have had ſome reſiſtance in the very act of denying his Maſter. The Spirit of God blew up ſome ſparks of ſhame in him at that very time; for after the very <hi>firſt</hi> denial, he went out into the porch, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.68. By his retirement he diſcovers ſome willingneſs to have avoided a further temptation. There is many times an exerciſe of diſpleaſure againſt it, while a man cannot avoid it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>That which I do, I allow not; that which I hate, that I do.</hi> I hate it even while I do it, and my hatred is excited againſt it, in the very act; he means it of ſins of infirmity. The Seed of God in the heart cannot conſent to ſin, but will many, times in the very acting of it be ſhewing its <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> weakly or ſtrongly againſt it. As a Needle touched with a <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> if it be diſturbed in its ſtanding to the North-pole, will ſhake and tremble while the impediment is upon it<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap> the Creed.</note>. Some demurrers were made in <hi>Peter</hi>'s heart, but fear over-ruled the plea; and it is probable his heart was not wholly aſleep even in the very act; elſe it is not likely he ſhould have been ſo ſuddenly rouzed. There is a voice in him. Grace ſpeaks for God, but it is over-ruled and oppreſt by a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41445:51"/> there are ſome pull-backs, ſome ſpiritual whiſperers even when it preſſes hard. <hi>Why art thou caſt down my Soul? Pſal.</hi> 43.5. There is the carnal part ſtirring in diſtruſt: <hi>Hope thou in God,</hi> there is a ſpiritual part riſing in Faith. A neat perſon may by ſtumbling he bemir'd in a dirty hole, but while he ſtumbles, there is a natural <hi>impetus,</hi> which endeavours to keep him upright; and if he doth fall, he ſtruggles till he be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when a Swine falls into a puddle, he lies grunting with pleaſure, and grumbles at any that will drag him out. Which leads me to a third thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>there is always a conſequent diſſent after the fall.</hi> He hath many rebukes in his Conſcience; whereas a natural mans ſin is brought up and nurtur'd with him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>They conſider not that they do evil;</hi> they lay it not to heart, eſpecially if it break not out in ſome foul and notorious manner. A renewed man is diſpleaſed at the very firſt motion that clambered up into his heart to entice him to his ſin; not only the fruit, but the root that bears it is odious to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity.</hi> By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he directs his hatred to the ſin of his Nature, by the ſame reaſon he will do it to the firſt motion that immediately brought forth that bitter fruit; which a natural man doth not. 'Tis the character of a wicked man to <hi>rejoyce</hi> that he hath done evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.14. which I think is never found in a renewed man; for this is indeed to be under the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and like their Father the <hi>Devil.</hi> But he condemns what he hath committed; and the greater his delight in it, the greater will his abhorrency be of it, and the more earneſt his cry to be rid of his burden. When he comes to ſee what contrariety there was in his act to the Law of God, it is impoſſible but his heart ſhould ſmite him. It cannot be, but that <hi>delight in the Law of God,</hi> which is a conſtitutive part of a regenerate man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. muſt revive, when the weights which did ſuſpend it are removed, and according to the degrees of his revived delight there will be ſuitable degrees of diſpleaſure with what was contrary to the object of it; for ſince a delight in the Law of God is eſſential to a renewed nature, that delight muſt needs produce an averſion from every thing contrary to that Law, otherwiſe it is not a delight: If there be not ſuch workings after a review of ſin, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that ſuch a man is not regenerate. But how long he may lie in a ſin, without acting conſideration about it, I cannot determine. He muſt needs have torment in his Soul, and a high diſaffection to his ſin, and himſelf for it, becauſe upon a review he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee how unlike to God it hath made him; how much it hath defiled his Soul, and impaired the Divine Image. No diſeaſe can be more grievous to the body than a ſin fallen into is to the new nature; it grieves and pains the new creature, which is reſtleſs till it be rid of the diſeaſe; the new nature is a tender thing. Though he be aſſured of its pardon, he is in anxiety till he finds it <hi>purged, Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Purge me with Hyſſop, and I ſhall be clean. David</hi> had been aſſured of the pardon of his Sin by <hi>Nathan;</hi> that would not quiet him, as long as the filth remained; he would not only have the guilt removed, but the ſtain waſhed off; as a man fallen in the dirt is deſirous not only to be raiſed up, but to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clean from any remainders of the mire. A good man hath a diſquietneſs in his heart, and is as much troubled at his ſin, as at a ſtinking wound, or a loathſom diſeaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.5, 6, 7, 8. and his <hi>ſorrow is continually before him, v.</hi> 17. He is more diſpleaſed with that ſin, than he is pleaſed at preſent with all the grace he hath. <hi>David</hi>'s ſin <hi>was ever before him, Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>Peter</hi> brought forth no other fruit immediately after the review of his ſin, but ſorrow, and exerciſed more grief for that, than he did joy at the preſent, for the not failing of his Faith; as a man is more troubled with a pain of the Tooth, or a fit of the Gout, than pleaſed with all the health in his vital parts, which is far greater than his pain. Here then is a difference; <hi>Regenerate</hi> men have <hi>pain</hi> in their ſins, natural men <hi>pleaſure;</hi> the one is aſhamed of his ſin, the other at beſt but aſhamed of his diſcredit; he condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it with ſo much ſeverity, rips his heart open before God, that if a wicked man ſhould hear him praying in his Cloſet after ſome ſin, he would think he did belye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or elſe that he were the vileſt Villain in the world. He will ſtudy no excuſes, and preſent no pleas to God for his ſin. If he hath not ſtrength to conquer it, he hath a voice to cry againſt it: Prayers are doubled; one Meſſenger goes to Heaven upon the heels of another, and ſo moderation, which was in his requeſts before, is turn'd to an unſatisfied importunity. So that you ſee, there is <hi>not a plenary conſent of will,</hi> but the diſſent is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and actual, if not antecedent or concomitant, yet alwaies conſequent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then doth the regenerate mans ſin ariſe from?</hi> It ariſeth</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either <hi>from a ſtrong paſſion, which many times bears down the bars both of grace and reaſon.</hi> That is not wholly voluntary which is done by the prevalency of paſſion, which ſuſpends the determination of the underſtanding, and conſequently the regular and free motion of the Will. Such was the accuſation of God in his <hi>Prophet,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> was guilty of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, all men are liars. I ſaid,</hi> 'tis true, <hi>all men are liars,</hi> even the Prophet too, but it was in <hi>my haſte.</hi> And in his haſte he accuſeth God of the breach of his promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, I am cut off from before thy Eyes.</hi> God hath either forgot his promiſe, or changed his reſolutions, for not one of them will be made good unto me. It was a paſſion in <hi>Moſes</hi> which made him guilty of that act of <hi>unbelief,</hi> that coſt him his excluſion from the land of promiſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.8, 10, 11, 12. God commands him to uſe his Tongue, not his Rod on the Rock; but the paſſion the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41445:51"/> good man was in by the provocation of the people, tranſported him beyond his bounds. <hi>Peter</hi>'s heart was not ſo full of courage as of Loyalty, his Zeal was put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by his fear. A ſtrong fit of paſſion may make a man, as good and meek as <hi>Moſes,</hi> fling away both the Tables of the Law, which otherwiſe would be as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From inconſiderateneſs.</hi> There cannot be a full conſent of Will, where a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate judgment doth not precede. Many a man, through an inconſiderate indulging his appetite, eats that meat which foments his humors into ſome dangerous diſeaſe. Sin creeps upon a good man when the livelineſs and activity of his Spirit in former duties is in a ſlumber; but another hath as great inclinations to ſin, when his underſtanding is in its ſtrength. <hi>Peter</hi> had the grace of faith, but he fell into his ſin for want of acting it; upon his repentance, it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.6. <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>remembred the words of the Lord.</hi> He had forgot Chriſts <hi>words,</hi> and that made him forget himſelf and his Maſter in that act of ſin. If our Saviour had caſt his Eye upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and excited his ſlumbering grace before the Maid had ſpoken to him, he might have prevented <hi>Peter</hi>'s fall as well as afterwards recovered him. If God had ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> with a meſſage to <hi>David,</hi> when his corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to put on its Arms, to have ſhewed him the vileneſs of his intentions, and excited him to a ſtout reſiſtance, he might have prevented the loſs of his innocency, as well as reſtor'd him after it had lain in the duſt ſo long. <hi>David</hi> might have kept his ſtanding, and diſmiſt thoſe inclinations, as he did his inconſiderate deſign of murdering <hi>Nabal</hi> and his family upon <hi>Abigail</hi>'s admonition, for which he bleſſeth God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. In ſhort, The <hi>motion</hi> of a regenerate man to ſin is <hi>violent,</hi> like a ſtone upward, the motion of an unrenewed man is <hi>natural,</hi> like a ſtone downwards. The Godly are violently purſued, but the wicked fottiſhly infatuated by a temptation.<note n="*" place="margin">Greenham.</note> And certainly when the ſtrength of the paſſion is abated, and the free exerciſe of reaſon recovered, there will be the exerciſe of grace again; for it is not conceiveable, that the habit of grace and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould be without the actual exerciſe of it, when the impediments are removed, and an occaſion preſented; ſo that he that doth not recover himſelf to his former exerciſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had this true ſeed of God infuſed into him.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Propoſition. <hi>Though a regenerate man may fall, and ſin have a temporary dominion, yet he recovers out of this ſtate, and for the moſt part returns to his former holineſs, and an increaſe of it, though not always to his former comforts.</hi> There are none whoſe ſins are recorded in Scripture, but there are ſome evidences of their repentance for it, or the acting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary grace. <hi>Davids</hi> ſin was groſs, and his repentance remarkable; he was more tender afterwards in point of Blood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16, 17. when he deſired Water out of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and it was brought him by three valiant men with the Jeopardy of their lives; he would not drink it, becauſe it was the Blood of the men that ventured their lives to ſatisfy his curioſity. <hi>Peters</hi> repentance is eminent, his affection is hot, for the truth of which he could appeal to his maſters omniſciency, <hi>John</hi> 21.17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> His courage is illuſtrious in aſſerting his Maſters honour in the face of the greateſt dangers, in which exerciſe you find him the Foreman of that Jury of the 12 <hi>Apoſtles</hi> before every Aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3.4.5. &amp;c. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> had diſcovered a diſtruſt of God in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> and <hi>Abimelechs</hi> courts, yet his faith afterward in his readineſs to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> was as glorious as his unbelief had been baſe, which gave him the title of the Father of the faithful. <hi>Noah</hi> who was drunk, and thereby expoſed to the deriſion of his Son, could not ſo well have curſt him, had he not abhorred the ſin as well as the reproach. And <hi>Lot,</hi> whoſe righteous Soul was vexed with the filthineſs of others, could not have a leſs vexation at his own when he came to know of it. Thoſe that affirm that mortal ſins expel grace, yet doubt whether they expel the gifts of the Spirit, one end whereof ſay they, is to render the Soul pliable and flexible to the motions of the Spirit.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Suarez:</hi> de Gratia. lib. 11 c. 3. num. 10, p. 415.</note> If they do not expel the gifts, I know not why they ſhould expel the grace which is under the manutenency of the Spirit of God in a particular manner. The <hi>Spirit luſts againſt the fleſh,</hi> as well as <hi>the fleſh againſt the Spirit,</hi> and the luſting of the Spirit will prevail as well as the luſting of the fleſh, and more, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. All natural things that are removed out of their proper place, are reſtleſs till they are reduc'd to their right ſtation. A good man is as Water, that though it be turned into a Maſs of Ice, wholly cold in the ways of God, yet ſtill there is a principle in him, (as there is in Ice) to return to his former form, figure and activity, upon the warm eruptions of the Spirit of God. There is a powerful voice behind him that brings him back, <hi>when he turns</hi> either <hi>to the right hand or to the left</hi> from the ways of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. By virtue of this ſeed within him, and the Spirit of God exciting it, that word which comes home to the Soul after a ſin, becomes efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly melting, and raiſes up ſprings of penitential motions, which could not ariſe ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were the ſpiritual life wholly departed. For a man that hath no habit of grace in him, cannot ſo ſuddenly concur with Gods propoſals, and exerciſe a repentance. In ſuch an one we ſee firſt a ſtupefaction of mind, and an unaptneſs to faith, no motions of a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though ſome preparation to it. But with a regenerate man it is otherwiſe. <hi>David</hi> being admoniſht by <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſtruck to the heart, and <hi>Peter</hi> preſently upon our Saviours look melted into tears. Their grace, like tinder, took fire preſently upon thoſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41445:52"/> ſmall but powerful occaſions; though it did not act at the time of their ſin, yet it had an aptneſs to act upon the removal of the impediments. Though <hi>Jonah</hi> ſeems to caſt off all regard of God and his command, yet upon the firſt occaſion in the <hi>Whales Belly,</hi> he brings forth excellent fruits of faith in a moment. <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. Grace in an inſtant upon the firſt motion of the Spirit will riſe up, and take its place from whence it ſeems to be depoſed. As a natural man under ſome ſting of Conſcience, and flaſh of a lightning conviction, may be reſtrained from ſin, yet his natural inclination to it remains, though ſuſpended at the preſent, and may be carried the quite contrary way, as the ſtream of a river by the force of the Tide is turned againſt its natural current, yet ſlides down its channel with its wonted calmneſs upon the removal of the force; ſo a good man under the violence of ſome luſt hath not his new nature changed, though at preſent it is reſtrain'd by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick force; ſo that as the one upon the taking off his conviction, returns to his ſin, ſo the other upon the removal of his fetters, returns to his holineſs with a greater ſpirit and delight. A wicked man may ſometimes do a good action, but he continues not in it. As a <hi>Planet</hi> is ſometimes retrograde, but ſoon returns to its direct courſe. When their Conſcience pinches them, they awake out of their trance. So a good man may ſin through infirmity, but he will revoke it by repentance. The ſeed of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him as the Sap in the Root of a Tree that recovers the leaves the next return of the Sun at the ſpring. He may ſink by nature and riſe again by grace; but the <hi>Devil,</hi> who ſinned at the beginning, fell and never roſe more.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not divide than into diſtinct Propoſitions, but take the words in order as they lie.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Nature of Pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41445:53"/>1. <hi>Conſider the words,</hi> and what <hi>notes</hi> they will afford to us.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Covering,</hi> as it alludes to the manner of writing, and ſo is the ſame with blotting out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blots out thy tranſgreſſion;</hi> whereby is implied, that ſin is a debt, and pardon is the remitting of it. It <hi>notes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>The nullity of the debt.</hi> A croſſed book will not ſtand good in law, becauſe the croſſing of the book implies the Satisfaction of the debt. A debt may be read in our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing in a croſſed book, but it cannot be pleaded. God may after pardon read our ſins in the book of his Omniſcience, but not charge them upon us at the bar of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>Gods willingneſs to pardon.</hi> Blots, not razeth. He engraves them not upon marble, he writes them not with a pen of Iron, or point of a diamond; writing upon wax is eaſily made plain.</p>
            <p n="3">[3.] <hi>The extent of it.</hi> Blotting ſerves for a great debt as well as a ſmall, a thouſand pound may as well, and as ſoon be daſht out by a blot as a thouſand pence.</p>
            <p n="4">[4.] <hi>The quickneſs of it upon repentance.</hi> It takes more time to write a debt in a book, than to croſs it out; one blow would obliterate a great deal of writing upon wax. Sins, that have been contracting many years, when God pardons he blots out in a moment.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Covering, <hi>as it alludes to the drowning the Aegpytians</hi> is expreſt by <hi>caſting into the depths of the Sea,</hi> Micah. 7.19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This notes alſo</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>Gods willingneſs to pardon. Caſts</hi> them, not <hi>lays</hi> them gently aſide, but flings them away with violence, as things that he cannot endure the ſight of, and is reſolved never to take notice of them more.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>Gods reality in pardon.</hi> He will caſt their ſins as far as the arm of his omnipotency can reach; If there be any place further than the depths of the Sea, thither they ſhall be thrown out of the ſight of his juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">[3.] <hi>The extent. [All]</hi> their ſins. The Sea covered <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Princes as well as the people. The mighty Lord, as well as the Common Souldier, ſank like lead in thoſe mighty waters.</p>
            <p n="4">[4.] <hi>The Duration of it.</hi> The Sea vomits up nothing that it takes into its lower bowels, things caſt into the depths of the Ocean never appear more. Rivers may be turned, and drain'd, but who can lave out the Ocean?</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>Not imputing.</hi> Not putting upon account, not charging the debt in a legal proceſs. To this is aequivalent the expreſſion of <hi>not remembring,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. <hi>I will not remember their ſins.</hi> An act of oblivion is paſt upon ſin. This <hi>notes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>That God will not exact the debt of thee.</hi> God doth not abſolutely forget ſin, for what he knows never ſlips out of his knowledg. So that his <hi>not remembring</hi> is rather an act of his will than a defect in his underſtanding. As when an act of oblivion is paſſed, the fact committed is not <hi>Phyſically</hi> forgotten, but <hi>legally,</hi> becauſe the fear of puniſhment is removed. God puts them out of the memory of his wrath, though not out of the memory of his knowledge. He doth remember them <hi>paternally</hi> to chaſtize thee for them, though not <hi>judicially</hi> to condemn thee.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>Not upbraid thee.</hi> Not with a ſcornful upbraiding mention them to caſt thee off, but with a merciful renewing the remembrance of them upon thy Conſcience, to excite thy repentance, and keep thee with in the due bounds of humility and reverence.</p>
            <p>More particularly the nature of pardon may be explained in theſe Propoſitions. We muſt not think that theſe expreſſions, as they denote pardon, do intimate in this act the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the <hi>being</hi> of ſin, <hi>nature</hi> of ſin, or <hi>demerit</hi> of ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The being and inherency of ſin is not taken away.</hi> Though ſin be not imputed to us, yet it is inherent in us. The being remains, though the power be dethroned. By pardon God takes away ſin, not as it is a pollution of the Soul, but as it is an inducement to wrath. Though remiſſion, and Sanctification are concomitants, yet they are diſtinct acts, and wrought in a diſtinct manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The nature of ſin is not taken away.</hi> Juſtification is a relative change of the perſon, not of the ſin; for though God will not by an act of his juſtice puniſh the perſon pardoned, yet by his holineſs he cannot but hate the ſin, becauſe though it be pardoned, it is ſtill contrary to God, and enmity againſt him. 'Tis not a change of the native malice of the ſin, but a non-imputation of it to the offender. Though the perſon ſinning be free from any indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſin is not freed from its <hi>malitia,</hi> and oppoſition to God. For though the law doth not condemn a juſtified perſon becauſe he is tranſlated into another ſtate, yet it condemns the acts of ſin, though the guilt of thoſe acts doth not redound upon the perſon to bring the wrath of God upon him. Though <hi>David</hi> had the ſins of murther and adultery pardon'd, yet this pardon did not make <hi>David</hi> a righteous perſon in thoſe acts, for it was murther and adultery ſtill, and the change was not in his ſin, but in his Soul and ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Demerit of ſin is not taken away.</hi> As pardon doth not alter ſins nature, ſo neither doth it alter ſins demerit, for to merit damnation belongs to the nature of it; ſo that we may look upon our ſelves as deſerving Hell, though the ſin whereby we deſerve it, be remitted. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don frees us from actual condemnation, but not, as conſidered in our own perſons, from the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41445:53"/> deſert of condemnation. As when a King pardons a thief, he doth not make the theft to become formally no theft, or to be meritoriouſly no capital crime. Upon thoſe <hi>two</hi> grounds of the nature and demerit of ſin, a juſtified perſon is to bewail it, and I queſtion not but the conſideration of this doth add to the triumph and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of the glorified Souls, whoſe chief work being to praiſe God for redemption, they cannot but think of the nature and demerit of that from which they were redeemed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The guilt of ſin, or obligation to puniſhment is taken away by pardon.</hi> Sin committed doth preſently by vertue of the law tranſgreſſed bind over the ſinner to death: but pardon makes void this obligation, ſo that God no longer accounts us perſons obnoxious to him. <hi>Peccatum remitti non aliud eſt quam non imputari ad poenam</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Durand. lib. 4. dict. 1. q. 7</hi> For ſin to be pardoned, is nothing elſe but not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in order to puniſhment.</note>. 'Tis a revoking the ſentence of the law againſt the ſinner; and God renouncing upon the account of the Satisfaction made by Chriſt to his juſtice, any right to puniſh a believer, doth actually diſcharge him upon his believing, from that ſentence of the law under which he lay in the ſtate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and alſo as he parts with this right to puniſh, ſo he confers a light upon a believer humbly to challenge it, upon the account of the Satisfaction wrought by his ſurety. God hath not only in his own mind and reſolution parted with this right of puniſhing, but alſo given an expreſs declaration of his will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> i. e. openly renouncing upon Chriſts account the right to puniſh, whence follows the non-imputation of ſin. <hi>Not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> The juſtice of God will not ſuffer that that ſin which is pardoned, ſhould be puniſhed; for can that be juſtice in a prince to pardon a thief, and yet to bring him to the gallows for that fact? Though the malefactor doth juſtly deſerve it, yet after a pardon and the word paſſed, it is not juſtly inflicted. God indeed doth puniſh for that ſin which is pardoned. Though <hi>Nathan</hi> by Gods Commiſſion had declared <hi>Davids</hi> ſin pardoned, yet the <hi>Sword</hi> was to ſtick in the bowels of his family, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10, 15. <hi>The Sword ſhall never depart from thy houſe, [the Lord hath put away thy ſin, thou ſhalt not dye.]</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>'Tis not a puniſhment in order to Satisfaction.</hi> Becauſe Chriſts Satisfaction had no flaw in it, and ſtood in need of nothing to eek it out: But 'tis for the vindication of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods holineſs, that he might not be thought an approver of ſin, and this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Davids</hi> puniſhment in the death of his child by <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>[Becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to Blaſpheme.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>'Tis not ſo much poenal as medicinal.</hi> A <hi>judg</hi> Commands a hand to be cut off, that is for puniſhment; a <hi>Phyſician</hi> and a <hi>Father</hi> order the ſame, but for the Patients cure, and the preſervation of the body. And though God after pardon acts not towards his people in the nature of a Judg, yet he never lays aſide the authority and affection of a Father. We are delivered from a Judges wrath, but not from a Fathers anger. In that remarkable dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inflicted upon <hi>Zachary</hi> for his <hi>unbelief, Luk</hi> 1.18.20. there was a confirmation of his Faith, as well as the chaſtiſement of his incredulity. The Angel upon his unbelieving deſire of a ſign, gives him a Teſtimony of the truth of his errand, but ſuch an one that ſhould make him feel in ſome meaſure the ſmart of his unbelief.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>If it be penal, 'tis not the eternal puniſhment due to ſin.</hi> 'Tis but temporary and not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered by wrath, which is the gall of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>This <hi>taking off</hi> the obligation to puniſhment is the true nature of pardon. Which will be evident from, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me. Shimei</hi> deſires <hi>David not, to impute</hi> iniquity, and <hi>not</hi> to <hi>remember</hi> it. It was not in <hi>Davids</hi> power abſolutely to forget it and <hi>Shimei</hi>'s confeſſing the fact with thoſe circumſtances in <hi>verſe</hi> 20. was enough to recall it to <hi>Davids</hi> memory, if he had forgot it; but he deſires <hi>David</hi> not to bring him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the penalty of the law for reviling his Soveraign.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Author of Pardon, God.</hi> For pardon is the Soveraign prerogative, of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth acquit a believing Sinner from all obligation to Satisfactory puniſhment upon the account of the Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis Gods act.</hi> Remiſſion is the <hi>Creditors</hi> not the Debtors act; though the Debtor be obliged in Juſtice to pay the debt, yet there is no obligation upon the Creditor to demand the debt, becauſe it is at his liberty to renounce or maintain his right to it; and God hath as much power as man to relax his right, provided it be with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to his own honour, and the holineſs of his nature, which he cannot deny for the ſinners ſafety, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>God cannot deny himſelf.</hi> Yet properly, ſay ſome, though ſin be a <hi>debt,</hi> God is not to be conſidered in pardon as a Creditor, becauſe ſin is not a pecuniary debt, but a criminal, and ſo God is to be conſidered as a <hi>governor,</hi> law-giver, guardian and executor of his laws, and ſo may diſpence with the ſeverities of them. If an inferior perſon tear an indictment, it may be brought again into Court; but if the chief Magiſtrate order the caſting it out, who can plead it? 'Tis <hi>Gods act,</hi> and <hi>if God juſtifies who can condemn? Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn?</hi> That <hi>God</hi> abſolves thee that hath power to condemn thee, that God who enacted the law whereby thou art ſentenced, proclaims the Goſpel whereby thou art reconcil'd. 'Tis an offended God who is a foregiving God; that God whoſe name thou haſt prophaned, whoſe patience thou haſt abuſed, whoſe laws thou haſt violated, whoſe mercy thou haſt ſlighted, whoſe juſtice thou haſt dared, and whoſe glory thou haſt ſtained.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41445:54"/>2. 'Tis not only his act but <hi>his prerogative, and he only can do it.</hi> God is the party wronged. <hi>Nemo poteſt remittere de jure alieno.</hi> This prerogative he glories in as peculiar to himſelf, the thoughts of this honour are ſo ſweet to him, that he repeats it twice, as a <hi>title</hi> he will not ſhare with another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. [<hi>I, even I am he that blots out thy tranſgreſſions.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning offenders is one of a Princes royalties. And this is reckoned among his <hi>Regalia,</hi> as a choice flower and jewel in his Crown. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. [<hi>for giving iniquity, tranſgreſſions and Sins.</hi> A Prince puniſheth by his miniſters, but pardons by himſelf. And indeed God is never ſo glorious as in acts of mercy: Juſtice makes him terrible, but mercy renders him amiable. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee God in his royalty, and beſt perfections, he diſplays himſelf in his goodneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Shew me thy glory,</hi> v. 19. <hi>I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee.</hi> I <hi>will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</hi> And though the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had a power of Remiſſion, and binding, that was only miniſterial and declarative, like that prophetical power which <hi>Jeremy</hi> had to root up nations, and deſtroy <hi>Jerm.</hi> 1.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> to declare Gods will in ſuch and ſuch Judgments, as he ſhould ſend him to pronounce. Men cannot pardon an infinite wrong done to an infinite juſtice. Forgiveneſs belongs to God, as</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Proprietor.</hi> He hath a greater right to us than we have to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Soveraign</hi> He is Lord over us, as we are his creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Governour of us,</hi> as we are parts of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>'Tis an act of his mercy:</hi> Not our merit. Though there be a conditional connexion between pardon, and repentance, and Faith, yet there is no meritorious connexion ariſeth from the Nature of thoſe graces, but remiſſion flows from the gracious indulgence of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis the very tenderneſs of mercy, the meltings of inward bowels, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.78. <hi>To give knowledg of Salvation, and Remiſſion of their ſins through the tender mercies of our God.</hi>

What <hi>Arithmetick</hi> can count all the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings up of mercy in the breaſt of God, and all the glances and all the doles of his pardoning grace towards his creatures? And he keeps this mercy by him as in a treaſury to this purpoſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving inquity,</hi> &amp;c. And is ſtill as full as ever, as the ſun which hath influenced ſo many animals and vegetables, and expelled ſo much darkneſs and cold, is ſtill as a ſtrong man able to run the ſame race, and perform by its light and heat the ſame operations. When <hi>mercy</hi> ſhews it ſelf in ſtate with all its train, it is but to uſher in pardoning grace, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.7. not a letter, not an attribute that makes up the compoſition of that <hi>name</hi> but is a friend and votary of mercy. And that latter clauſe a learned man explains of Gods <hi>clemency, He will by no means clear the guilty, viſiting the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. which he renders thus; <hi>He will not utterly cut off and deſtroy, but when he doth viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, it ſhall be but to the third or fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, not for ever.</hi> This name of God is urged by <hi>Moſes, Number</hi> 14.17. <hi>Now I beſeech thee, let the power of my Lord be great; the Lord is long-ſuffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſſion, and by no means clearing the guilty, viſiting the iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> Where <hi>Moſes</hi> repeats this clauſe more particularly than he doth the other parts of his name; which ſurely he would not have done, and pleaded it as a Motive to God to pardon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if he had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it of God's <hi>clemency;</hi> for otherwiſe he had dwelt more upon the argument of Juſtice than upon that of mercy, which had not been proper to edg his preſent petition with. Nay it is ſuch pure mercy, the genuine birth of mercy, that it partakes of its very name, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bear the name of their Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I will be merciful to their iniquity,</hi> which in the <hi>Prophet, Jer.</hi> 31.34. whence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> quotes it, is, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is ſo, will appear, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>No attribute could be the firſt motive of pardon but this.</hi> His Juſtice would loudly cry for vengeance, and flame out againſt ungrateful ſinners. His holineſs would make him abhor not only the embraces but the very ſight or ſuch filthy creatures as we are. His power would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to receive and execute the Commands of his juſtice and holineſs, did not compaſſion ſtep in to qualify.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconſtrained mercy.</hi> Men pardon many times, becauſe they are too weak to puniſh. But God wants not power to inflict Judgments, neither doth man want weakneſs to ſink under it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>When we were without ſtrength, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> God wanted not ſufficient reaſon to juſtify a ſevere proceeding both in the <hi>quality</hi> of ſin, every ſin being a contrariety to the law, Soveraignty, work, glory, yea the very being of God, now for God to pardon that which would pull him out of his throne, hath blemiſhed the creation, robs him of his honour, muſt be an act of the richeſt and pureſt mercy: And in the <hi>quantity,</hi> multitudes of ſins of this curſed quality as numerous as motes in the Sun-beams. 'Tis impoſſible for the nimbleſt Angel to write down the extravagancies of men committed in the ſpace of <hi>twenty four hours,</hi> if he could know all the operations of heir Souls as well as their outward actions; all thoſe God doth ſee, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> and yet is ready to pardon in the midſt of numberleſs provocations.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Reſolv'd and deſigned mercy.</hi> 'Tis not through inadvertency and inſenſibleneſs of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41445:54"/> the aggravating circumſtances of them. God muſt needs know the nature and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of all thoſe ſins he himſelf laid upon Chriſt. Yea God hath an actuated knowledge of all when he is about to pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22. God reckons up their ſins of omiſſions: They had been <hi>weary of him,</hi> and had <hi>not brought</hi> to him their ſmall Cattle; had preferr'd their Lambs and Kids before his Service, wearied him with their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, endeavoured to tire him out of the Government of the World. What could one have expected after this black Scroul, but Fire-balls of Wrath? Yet <hi>he blots them out, v.</hi> 25. though all thoſe ſins were freſh in his memory. Nay, the <hi>Name</hi> we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned becomes our Solicitor, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. <hi>For my holy Names ſake which you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Delightful and pleaſant mercy.</hi> He delights in pardoning mercy, as a Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his Children. He is therefore called <hi>the Father of mercy,</hi> Micah 7.18. <hi>he pardons iniquity, and retains not his anger for ever, becauſe he delights in mercy.</hi> Never did we take ſo much pleaſure in ſinning, as God doth in forgiving. Never did any penitent take ſo much pleaſure in receiving, as God doth in giving a pardon: He ſo much delights in it, that he counts it his wealth; <hi>Riches of grace, riches of mercy,</hi> glorious riches of mercy; no Attribute elſe is called his riches. He ſighs when he muſt draw his Sword, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, O</hi> Ephraim! But when he blots out iniquity, then it is, <hi>I, even I am he that blots out your tranſgreſſions for my Names ſake.</hi> His delight in this is equal to the delight he hath in his Name. This is pure mercy, to change the Tribunal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice into a Throne of Grace; to beſtow pardons, where he might inflict puniſhments, and to put on the deportment of a Father inſtead of that of a Judge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Act of his Juſtice.</hi> Thoſe Attributes which ſeem contrary, are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to produce forgiveneſs: Yet God is not to be conſidered in pardon only as <hi>Judex,</hi> but <hi>paternus Judex;</hi> there is a compoſition of <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> in this act; Free Grace on God's part, but Juſtice upon the account of Chriſt. That God will accept of a ſatisfaction is Mercy, that he will not forgive without a ſatisfaction is Juſtice: Mercy forgives it in us, though Juſtice did puniſh it in Chriſt. Chriſt by his death paid the debt, and God by the Reſurrection of Chriſt diſcharged the debt; and therefore the Juſtice of God is engaged to beſtow pardon upon a Believer. God <hi>ſet forth</hi> Chriſt as <hi>a propitiation, that he might be juſt, and</hi> therefore <hi>a juſtifier of him that believes, Rom.</hi> 3.26. Either the debt is paid, or not; if not, then Chriſt's Death is in vain; if it be, then God's Juſtice is ſo equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as not to demand a <hi>ſecond</hi> payment. Therefore another <hi>Apoſtle</hi> joyns <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>righteous;</hi> it might have been faithful and merciful, faithful and loving; but faithful and righteous, or juſt takes in the Attribute, which is moſt terrible to man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi>

Yea, he ſeemed to love our Salvation more than he loved the life of his Son; ſince the end is always more amiable than the means, and the means only lovely as they reſpect the end.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The Certainty of Forgiveneſs.</hi> God muſt deny Chriſt's payment, before he can deny
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41445:55"/> thy pardon. God will not deny what his Son hath earned ſo dearly; and what he earn'd was for us, and not for himſelf. Did God pardon many before Chriſt died, and will he not pardon believing Souls ſince Chriſt died? Some were certainly ſaved before the coming of Chriſt: Upon what account? Not for their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is but a Ragg, and could not merit infinite grace. Not by the law; that thundered nothing but death, and condemned millions; but never breathed a pardon to one perſon. Or was it by their vehement ſupplications? Thoſe could not make an infinite righteouſneſs mutable: Juſtice muſt be preferred before the cries of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and if thoſe could have done it, God would not have been at the expence of his Sons Blood. Therefore it muſt be upon this account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>For the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> Did God pardon upon truſt, and will he not much more upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Did he forgive when there was only a promiſe of payment, and ſome thouſands of years to run out before it was to be made? and will he not much more forgive, ſince he hath all the debt paid into his hands? Would God remit ſin when Chriſt had nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand to ſhew for it? and now that he hath a publick teſtimony, and acquittance, will he not much more do it? Seeing his <hi>purging our ſins,</hi> or expiating them by his death, was the ground of his exaltation to the honour of ſitting at the right hand of God in our natures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> it is a certain evidence of the grant of pardon upon the account of this Sacrifice to thoſe that ſeek it in Gods Methods, ſince God hath ſhewen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo pleaſed with it: For it is clear, that becauſe Chriſt <hi>loved righteouſneſs and hated iniquity, i. e.</hi> kept up the honour of Gods juſtice and holineſs by the offering himſelf to death, that God hath given him a portion above all his fellows.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The extent of it.</hi> Both to <hi>original</hi> and actual ſin, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſin of the world.</hi> Sin of the World, the ſin of humane nature, that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Of this mind is <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and others, that original ſin is not imputed to any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſince the death of Chriſt. But howſoever this be, it is certain it is taken away from Believers, as to its imputation. Chriſt was <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. to bear all ſin. It had been an imperfect payment to have paid the Intereſt, and let the Principal remain; or to have paid the Principal, and let the Intereſt remain. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. and therefore no damning matter or guilt left in arrear. It had been folly elſe for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to have publiſhed a defying challenge to the whole Creation to have brought an Indictment againſt a juſtified perſon, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay anything to the charge of Gods elect?</hi>) if the leaſt crime remained unremitted for the juſtice of God, the ſeverity of the Law, the acuteneſs of Conſcience, or the malice of the Devil to draw up into a charge. Since the end of his coming was <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> whereby he had acquired a power over man, he leaves not therefore any one ſin of a Believer unſatisfied for, which may continue, and eſtabliſh the Devils right over him. If the redemption only of the <hi>Jews</hi> with the excluſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the firſt compact ſeemed to diſpleaſe him, to ſhed his blood for ſmall Sins only would have been as little to his content. It had been too low a work for ſo great a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to have undergone thoſe unknown ſufferings for debts of a ſmaller value, and to ſhed that ineſtimable Blood for the payment of Farthings and leave talents unſatisfied. Certainly, God ſent not his Son, but with an inten ion his Blood ſhould be improved to the higheſt uſes for thoſe that perform the covenant conditions, and that Father who would have us honour his Son as we honour himſelf, will ſurely honour his Sons ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the extenſive effects of it, as he would honour his own mercy, ſince they are both ſo ſtraitly linkt together. And it is as much for the glory of Chriſts ſatisfaction, as for the honour of his fathers mercy, to paſs by the greateſt tranſgreſſions.</p>

God exacted a price ſuitable to the debt he foreſaw men would owe him, for he knew how much the Sum would amount unto. When he gave Chriſt, he intended him for the juſtification of <hi>many offences,</hi> Rom. 5.16. <hi>The free gift is of many offences unto juſtification,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the gift of God, <hi>v.</hi> 15. And therefore ſince God cannot be miſtaken in the greatneſs of the Sum, becauſe of his infinite knowledge, it had been a greater act of wiſdom not to provide any remedy at all, than not to do it thoroughly. If the continuance of that imperfect remiſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> was drawn out for above 3000 years and more, and the enjoyment of happineſs made good to them meerly upon Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, ſurely it will be much more upon his actual performing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.

Therefore God hath erected a ſtanding Office of Advocacy for Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. in Heaven, for the repreſenting of his wounds and ſatisfaction, and beſpeaking a continuance of grace to us.

               </gap> which notes, <hi>actum perpetuum,</hi> the conſtant effect of his death. And ſince as I ſaid before, Chriſt hath an higher portion than others, becauſe he loved righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in this portion he hath a joy and gladneſs; but his joy would certainly be ſullied, if pardon ſhould not be continued to thoſe for whom he purchaſed it.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) <hi>The worth of it.</hi> That muſt be of incomparable value that was purchaſed at ſo great a price, as the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28 (So it is called by reaſon of the union of the divine nature with the humane, conſtituting one perſon.) 'Tis Blood, which all the Gold and Silver, and the Stones and Duſt of the Earth turned into Pearls, could not equal. God underſtood the worth of it, who in juſtice would require no more of his Son at leaſt than the thing was worth, not a drop of Blood more than the value of it. Neither ſurely would Chriſt, who could not be miſtaken in the juſt price, have parted with more than was neceſſary for the purchaſe of it. It would have beggar'd the whole Creation to have paid a price for it. The Prayers and Services of a gracious Soul, though God delights in them, could not be a ſufficient recompence. And the bare mercy of God, without the concurrence of his provokt juſtice, could not grant it, though his Bowels naturally are troubled at the afflictions of his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Extenſiveneſs, fulneſs, or perfectneſs of pardon.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Act; forgiving, covering, not imputing.</hi> 2. In the <hi>Object; iniquities, tranſgreſſions, and ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Perfect in reſpect of ſtate.</hi> God retains no hatred againſt a pardoned perſon. He never imputes ſin <hi>formally,</hi> becauſe he no more remembers it, though <hi>virtually</hi> he may, to aggravate the offence a Believer hath fallen into after his juſtification. So <hi>Job poſſeſſed the ſins of his youth.</hi> And Chriſt tacitly put <hi>Peter</hi> in remembrance of his denial of him. The grant is compleat here, though all the fruits of remiſſion are not enjoyed till the day of judgment, and therefore in Scripture, ſin is ſaid <hi>then</hi> to be forgiven. 'Tis a queſtion whether Believers ſins will be mentioned at the day of judgment. Some think they will, becauſe all men are to give an account. Methinks there is ſome evidence to the contrary. Our Saviour never mentioned the unworthy carriage of his Diſciples to him in his ſufferings, and after his reſurrection ſeems to have removed from him all remembrance of it. 'Tis not to be expected, that a loving Husband will lay open the faults of his tender Spouſe upon the day of the publick ſolemnization of the nuptials. But if it be otherwiſe, 'tis not to upbraid them, but to enhance their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirations of his grace. He will diſcover their graces as well as their ſin, and unſtop the Bottles of their tears, as well as open the Book of their tranſgreſſions. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour upon <hi>Maries</hi> anointing him, applauds her affection, but mentions not her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iniquity.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs be perfect.</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>All Gods Actions are ſuitable to his Nature.</hi> What God doth, he doth as a God. And is he perfect in his other works, and not in his Mercy, which is the choiceſt flower in his Crown? God ſees blacker circumſtances in our ſins, than an inraged Conſcience, or a malicious <hi>Devil</hi> can repreſent: But God pardons not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our apprehenſions, which though great in a tempeſtuous Conſcience, yet are not ſo high as Gods knowledge of it.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>The Cauſe of pardon is perfect.</hi> Both the mercy of God, and the merits of Chriſt are immutably perfect. 'Tis for his own glory, his own mercies ſake, that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. He will not dimm the luſtre of his own Crown, by leaving the effect of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect, or ſatisfying the importunities of his mercy by halves. The Saints in Heaven have not a more perfect righteouſneſs, whereby they continue their ſtanding, than thoſe on Earth have; for, though inherent righteouſneſs here is ſtain'd, yet imputed, upon which pardon is founded, is altogether ſpotleſs. A righteouſneſs that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in reſpect of the perſon, hath a ſufficiency for Devils, had it a congruity; but it hath both for us, becauſe manifeſted in our natures.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41445:56"/> meet with monſtrous ſinners in the likeneſs of Beaſts, and Devils, except none from ſuing out a pardon in the court of mercy. The Almightineſs of his mercy doth as much tranſcend our higheſt iniquities, as it doth our ſhalloweſt apprehenſions. Our ſins, as well as our ſubſtance, are but as the Duſt of the Ballance, as eaſily to be blown away by his grace, as the other puft into nothing by his power. No ſin is excepted in the Goſpel, but that againſt the holy Ghoſt, becauſe it doth not ſtand with the honour of God to pardon them who wilfully ſcorn the means, and account the Redeemer no better than an Impoſtor. No man can expect in reaſon he ſhould be ſaved by mercy, who by a wilful malice againſt the Son of God, tramples upon the free offers of grace, and provokes mercy it ſelf to put on the deportment of juſtice, and call in reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath to its aſſiſtance, for the vindication of its deſpiſed honour. The infinite grace of God diſſolves the greateſt miſts, as well as the ſmalleſt exhalations, and melts the thick clouds of ſin as well as the little icicles.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>The Quantity.</hi> Hath God ever put a reſtraint upon his grace, and promiſe, that we ſhall find mercy if we ſin but to ſuch a number, and no more? 'Tis not agreeable to the greatneſs and majeſty of Gods mercy, to remit one part of the debt, and to exact the other. It conſiſts not with the motive of pardon, which is his own love, to be both a friend and an enemy at the ſame time, in pardoning ſome, and charging others; and thus his grace would rather be a mockery, and deriſion of men. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it conſiſt with the end of pardon, which is Salvation; for to give an half par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is to give no Salvation; ſince if the leaſt guilt remains unremitted, it gives juſtice an unanſwerable plea againſt us. What profit would it be to have ſome forgiven, and be damned for the remainder? Had any one ſin for which Chriſt was to have made a compenſation, remain'd unſatisfied, the Redeemer could not have riſen; ſo if the ſmalleſt ſin remains unblotted, it will hinder our riſing from the power of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, and make the pardon of all the reſt as a nullity in Law. But it is the glory of God to paſs by all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.31. <hi>It is his glory to paſs over a tranſgreſſion.</hi> 'Tis the glory of a man to paſs by an offence. 'Tis a diſcovery of an inward principle or property, which is an honour for a man to be known the maſter of. If it be his glory to paſs by a ſingle and ſmall injury, then to paſs by the more heinous, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous offences is a more tranſcendent honour, becauſe it evidenceth this property to be in him, in a more triumphant ſtrength, and power. So that it is a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the illuſtrious vigor of mercy in God, to paſs by mountainous, and heaped up tranſgreſſions than to forgive only ſome few iniquities of a leſſer guilt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and whereby they have tranſgreſt againſt me.</hi> Therefore when God tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he would give them a general diſcharge in the fulleſt terms imaginable, to remove all jealouſie from men, either becauſe of the number, or the aggravations of their ſins, he knew not how to leave expreſſing the delight he had in it, and the honour which accrued to him by it, <hi>It ſhall be to me a name of joy, a praiſe and honour before all the nations of the earth.</hi> He would get himſelf an honourable name by the large riches of his Clemency. Mercy is as infinite as any other attribute, as infinite as God himſelf: And as his power can create incomprehenſible multitudes of worlds, and his juſtice kindle unconceiveable Hells; ſo can his mercy remit innumerable ſins.</p>

            <p n="5">V. The <hi>Effect of Pardon.</hi> That is <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The greateſt evil is taken away, ſin, and the dreadful conſequents of it.</hi> Other evils are temporal, but thoſe know no period in a doleful Eternity. There is more evil in ſin, than good in all the creatures. Sin ſtript the fallen Angels of their Excellency, and diſpoſſeſſed them of the Seat of Bleſſedneſs. It fights againſt God, it diſparages all his Attributes, it deforms and deſtroys the creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. Other evils may have ſome mixture of good to make them tolerable, but ſin being <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> without the mixture of any good, engenders nothing but deſtruction, and endleſs damnation. Into what miſeries, afflictions, ſorrows, hath that one ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> hurl'd all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? what ſcreechings, wounds, pangs, horrours, doth it make in troubled Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? How did it deface the Beauty of the Son of God, that created and upheld the World, with ſorrow in his Agonies, and the ſtroak of Death on the Croſs? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands, millions of poor creatures have been damned for ſin, and are never like to ceaſe roaring under an inevitable Juſtice? Ask the damned, and their groans, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, howlings, will read thee a dreadful Lecture of ſins ſinfulneſs, and the puniſhment of it. And is it not then an ineſtimable bleſſedneſs to be delivered from that, which hath wrought ſuch deplorable Executions in the World?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The greateſt Bleſſings are conferred.</hi> Pardon is God's Family-Bleſſing, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar mercy of his choiceſt darlings: He hands out other things to wicked men, but he deals out this only to his Children.</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>The Favour of God.</hi> Sin makes thee <hi>Satan</hi>'s Drudge, but pardon makes thee God's Favourite. We may be ſick to death, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and be God's Friends; ſold to ſlavery, with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and yet be dear to him; thrown into a Lions Den, with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and be greatly beloved; poor, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had only Doggs for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions to dreſs his Sores, and yet have a Title to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. But we can never be beloved, if we are unpardoned; no ſhare in his friendſhip, his love, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, without a pardon. All created evils cannot make us loathſom in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied State; nor all created goods make us lovely under guilt. Sin is the only Object of God's hatred; while this remains, his Holineſs cannot but hate us; when this is removed, his righteouſneſs cannot but love us; remiſſion and favour are inſeparable, and can never be diſ-joyned. 'Tis by this he makes us as a Diadem upon his Head, a Bracelet on his Arm; it is by this he writes us upon the Palms of his Hands, makes us his peculiar Treaſure, even as the Apple of his Eye, which Nature hath ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fenced.</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>Acceſs to God.</hi> A Prince may diſcard a Favourite for ſome guilt, and though he may reſtore him to his liberty in the Common-wealth, yet he may not admit him to the favour of his wonted privacies. But a pardoned man hath an acceſs to God, to a ſtanding and perpetually ſettled Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we have acceſs.</hi> Guilt frights us, and makes us loath the very ſight of God: Pardon encourageth us to come near to him: Guilt reſpects him as a Judge, Pardon as a Friend. Who can confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or hopefully call upon an angry and condemning God? But who cannot but hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call upon a forgiving God? Sin is the partition wall between God and us, and Pardon is the demoliſhing of it. Forgiveneſs is never beſtowed, but the Scepter is held out to invite us to come into God's preſence. And what can be more deſirable than to have not only the favour of, but a free acceſs at any time to the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and at length an everlaſting being with him?</p>
            <p n="3">[3.] <hi>Peace of Conſcience.</hi> There muſt needs be fair Weather when Heaven ſmiles upon us. All other things breed diſquietneſs. Sin was a Thorn in <hi>David</hi>'s Crown; his Throne and Scepter were but miſerable comforters, while his guilt overwhelmed him. The glory of the World is no ſoveraign Plaiſter for a wounded Spirit: Other enjoyments may pleaſe the ſenſe, but this only can gratifie the Soul. God's Thunder made <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:41445:57"/> tremble, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. But the probability of a gracious Pardon would make a damned Soul ſmile in the midſt of tormenting flames. How often hath the ſenſe of it raiſed the hearts of Martyrs, and made the Sufferers ſing, while the Spectators wept? Though this, I muſt confeſs, is not always an inſeparable concomitant. There is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Pardon, and the comfort of it; that may paſs the Seal of the King, without the knowledge of the Malefactor. Pardon indeed always gives the <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> a right to peace of Conſcience, but not always <hi>jus in re,</hi> the poſſeſſion of it. There may be an actual ſeparation between Pardon, and actual Peace, but not between Pardon, and the ground of Peace.</p>
            <p n="4">[4.] <hi>It ſweetens all mercies.</hi> Other mercies are a ring, but pardon is the <hi>Diamond</hi> in it. A juſtified perſon may ſay, I have temporal mercies and a pardon too, I live in repute in the world and Gods favour too; riches increaſe, and my peace with God doth not diminiſh. I have health with a pardon, friends with a pardon, as <hi>Job ch.</hi> 29.3, 6, 7. among all other bleſſings this he counts the chiefeſt, that <hi>Gods Candle ſhin'd upon his head.</hi> A Priſoner for ſome capital crime, may have all outward accommodations, for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dyet, attendance, without a real happineſs, when he expects to be called to his tryal before a ſevere judge, from whom there is no appeal, and that will certainly both paſs, and cauſe to be executed a ſentence of death upon him. So though a man wallows in all outward contents, he cannot write himſelf bleſſed, while the wrath of God hangs over his head, and he knows not how ſoon he may be ſummon'd before Gods tribunal, and hear that terrible voice, <hi>Go thou curſed.</hi> What comfort can a man take in Houſes, Land, Health, when he conſiders he owes more than all his eſtate is worth? So, what comfort can a man have in any thing in this world, when he may hourly expect an arreſt from God, and a demand of all his debts, and he hath not ſo much as one farthing of his own or any intereſt in a ſufficient ſurety? We may have honour and a curſe, wealth and a curſe, Children and a curſe, health and long life and a curſe, learning and a curſe, but we can never have pardon and a curſe. Our outward things may be gifts, but not bleſſings without a pardon.</p>
            <p n="5">[5.] <hi>It ſweetens all afflictions.</hi> A frown with a pardon is better than a thouſand ſmiles without it. Sin is the ſting of croſſes, and Remiſſion is a taking the ſting out of them. A ſight of Heaven will mitigate a croſs on earth. The ſtones about <hi>Stephens</hi> ears did ſcarce afflict him, when he ſaw his Saviour open Heaven to entertain him. To ſee death ſtaring us in the face, and an angry and offended God above, ready to charge all our guilt, is a doleful ſpectacle. <hi>Look upon my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my ſins,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 25.18. Sin doth embitter and adds weight to an affliction, but the removal of ſin doth both lighten it and ſweeten it.</p>

The pooreſt begger with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is higher than the greateſt prince without it. How can we enjoy a quiet hour, if our debt be not remitted, ſince we owe more than we are able to pay? You may dye with a forfeited reputation, and yet be happy; but what happineſs, if you die with unpardoned guilt?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>There muſt either be pardon or puniſhment.</hi> The law doth oblige either to obedience or ſuffering: the Commands of it muſt be obſerved, or the penalty indured. God will not relax the puniſhment without a valuable conſideration. If it be not executed, the creature may accuſe God of want of wiſdom in enacting it, or defect of power in maintaining it. Therefore there muſt be an exact obſervance of the law, which no creature after the firſt deviation is able to do; or an undergoing the penalty of it, which no Sinner is able to bear. There muſt therefore be a remiſſion of this puniſhment for the good of the creature, and the Satisfaction of the law by a ſurety, for the honour of Gods juſtice. If we have not therefore an intereſt in the ſurety, the purchaſer of remiſſion, we muſt lye under the ſeverity of the law in our perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>You can call nothing an act of Gods Love towards you, while you remain unpardoned.</hi> What is there you do enjoy, which may not conſiſt with his hatred, as well as his Love? Have we knowledge? So have Devils. Have we riches? So had <hi>Nabal</hi> and <hi>Cain.</hi> Have we honour? So had <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod.</hi> Have we Sermons? So had <hi>Judas,</hi> the beſt that ever were preacht. Nothing, nothing but a pardon is properly a bleſſing. How can that man take pleaſure in any thing he hath, when all the threatnings in the book of God are as ſo many arrows directed againſt him?</p>

               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>'Tis that God who would have pardon'd thee if thou wouldſt have accepted of it, who will condemn if thou doſt utterly refuſe it.</hi> 'Tis that God thou haſt provoked, offended, and diſhonoured.

               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>If once pardoned, thou will be always pardoned.</hi> For the firſt pardon Chriſt paid his blood, for the continuance he doth but plead his blood, and we cannot be without a pardon till Chriſt be without a plea He merited the continuance as well as the firſt remiſſion. Will our Saviour be more backward to intercede for pardon, than he was to bleed and pray for it on earth? Would not our deareſt Saviour let ſin go unremitted when he was to conteſt with the Fathers wrath, and will he let it go unpardoned when he is only to ſolicite his Fathers mercy? Thou ſhalt not want the daily renewals of it, ſince he is only to preſent his blood in the moſt holy place, ſeeing an ignominious and painful death did not ſcare him from the purchaſe of it upon the Croſs. As Gods heart is more ready to give than we are to ask forgiveneſs, ſo is Chriſts heart more ready to plead for the continuance of it, than we are daily to begg it; for he Loves his people more than they can Love him, or Love themſelves.

Thy Pardon was paſt by the Spirit of God in thy own Conſcience, it will then be paſt by the Son of God in thy own hearing. That Saviour that did merit it upon his Croſs, will pronounce it upon his Throne: The Book ſhall be laid out of ſight, there ſhall be no more writing in the Book of God's Omniſcience to charge thee, or of thy Conſcience to affright thee: His fatherly anger ſhall for ever ceaſe; and as all diſpoſition to ſin, ſo all paternal correction for it ſhall be for ever aboliſht, and forgiveneſs be fully compleat in all the glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it.</p>

Sin is not little in reſpect of the formality of it, but in reſpect of the matter, in reſpect of the temptation; and this littleneſs is an aggravation of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">[3] <hi>Doſt thou know how God hath puniſhed the leaſt ſin?</hi> A drop of ſin may bring a Deluge of Miſery. An <hi>Atom</hi> of ſin is ſtrong enough to overturn a World. It was but an Apple that poiſoned <hi>Adam,</hi> and his whole Poſterity. Leſs ſins are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in Hell, than are pardoned here. God caſts off <hi>Saul</hi> for leſs ſins than he pardoned <hi>David</hi> for. How many Ships have been deſtroyed upon ſmall Sands as well as great Rocks?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Fewneſs of ſins is no argument of pardon.</hi> Conceive, if thou canſt, the amiableneſs and luſtre of the Angels, how far beyond the glory of the Sun it was; yet one ſin diveſted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41445:59"/> them of all their glory. It was but one ſin kindled Hell for the fallen Angels, Every ſin muſt receive <hi>a juſt recompence of reward. Heb.</hi> 2.2. Shall one ſingle ſin intitle thee to Hell? what will millions of ſins then intitle thee to? One ſin is too much againſt God. Had thy iniquities been never ſo few, Chriſt muſt have died to anſwer the Pleas of his Fathers Juſtice againſt thee. [Every ſin is Rebellion againſt God as a Soveraign, undutifulneſs to God as a Father<note n="*" place="margin">Burges.</note>.] Contempt of God as a Governour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Devil before God; the Devil that would deſtroy and damn thee, before God that made thee, and preſerves thee; a preferring the Devil's temptations before God's promiſes.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The commonneſs of ſin is no argument of pardon.</hi> Many <hi>Angels</hi> combin'd in the firſt Conſpiracy againſt God; but as they were Companions in ſin, ſo are they Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in torments. The commonneſs of <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſin made the louder cry, and haſtened the ſeverer Judgment: Not one Inhabitant eſcaped, but only righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Common ſins will have common Plagues. It doth rather aggravate thy ſin, than plead for pardon, when thou wilt rather follow mens Example to offend God, than conform to God's Law to pleaſe him. Sin was common in the Old World, for <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their ways, Gen.</hi> 6.12. and all were ſwept away by the deſtroying De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. To walk according to the courſe of the World, is ſo far from being a foundation of pardon, that it is made a Character of a Child of the Devil: To walk according to the courſe of the World, is to walk according to the pattern of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to be in the number of the Children of Wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Wherein in times paſt you walked accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Forbearance of puniſhment is no argument of pardon,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil-work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> Forbearance is made uſe of by men, to make them ſin more deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more headily. <hi>Fully ſet,</hi> all checks ſilenced and ſtopt. Forbearance is no acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; it argues not God's forgiving the debt; the debt is due, though it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſued for; and the longer the debt remains unpaid, the greater Sum will the Intereſt amount unto; becauſe, the longer God doth forbear puniſhment, the longer time thou haſt for Repentance; the account for that time will run high.</p>
               <p>That God doth not puniſh, is an argument of his patience, not of his pardoning mercy. God laughs at Sinners: he ſees their day is coming, though they may be jocund and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a pardon. God's forbearance may be in Juſtice; he may be brewing the Cup, and mixing that which thou art to drink. Priſoners may be reprieved one Aſſize, and executed the next: Reprieval of Execution is no allowance of the Crime, or change of the Sentence.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Proſperity is no ſign of pardon.</hi> Oh! I am not only born with, and forborn, but I have a great addition of outward contentments ſince my ſin.</p>
               <p>That which you make an argument of pardon, may be an argument of condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſaph</hi> was much troubled at the proſperity of the wicked; but at laſt ſaith, <hi>Pride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth them as a Chain, and violence covers them as a garment, Pſal.</hi> 73.6. That kindneſs which ſhould have made them melt, made them preſume. That which ſhould broach thy Repentance, enflames thy Pride: Thy goods may increaſe thy ſins.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>Forgetfulneſs of thy ſin and Commiſſion long ago, is no ſign of pardon, and therefore having no checks for them is no ſign of pardon.</hi> God doth not forget though thou doſt, no ſin ſlips from the memory of his knowledge though now he doth caſt many ſins away from the memory of his juſtice. In regard of Gods eternity the firſt ſins are accounted as committed this moment, for in that there is no ſucceſſion of time, and the ſins thou haſt committed twenty years ago, are as freſh as if thou hadſt acted them all ſince thy coming into the congregation. <hi>Joſephs brethren, Gen.</hi> 37.24. laboured to wipe out the thoughts of their late cruelty by their eating and drinking, when the cries and tears of their brother were freſh in their memory, and might have dampt their jollity. His affliction troubled them not, his relation to them, his youth, and their Fathers Love to him could not make them relent; but <hi>twenty two years</hi> after, conſcience began to fly in their faces, when awakened by a powerful affliction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42 21. Is not thy conſcience oftentimes a remembrancer to thee, of thy old forgotten ſins, and doth it not turn over the old records thou hadſt quite forgot?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Hopes of Gods mercy are no grounds of thy being pardoned.</hi> Gods mercy is not barely enough, for then Chriſt needed not have dyed for ſin. Nor Chriſts death enough, without the condition of that covenant whereby God will make over the intereſt and merits of his death to thee. Gods mercy muſt be conſidered, but in Gods own way. God is merciful, but his Mercy muſt not aboliſh his Truth. Doth not a Judges mercy conſiſt with condemning
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41445:59"/> a malefactor? God hath been merciful to thee, and thou would'ſt not accept of it; thou wouldſt not hear mercy ſpeak in a day of grace; why then ſhould not juſtice ſpeak in a day of vengeance? Thou would'ſt not hear a God of mercy when he cryed to thee, how then ſhould mercy hear thee when thou comeſt to begg?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some falſe grounds, why thoſe that are pardoned, think themſelves not pardoned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Great afflictions are not ſigns of an unpardoned ſtate. Moſes</hi> had ſinned by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, <hi>Aaron</hi> by making a golden calf, God pardoned their ſin but took <hi>vegeance on their inventions,</hi> Pſal. 99.8. <hi>Thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou tookeſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Nathan</hi> in his meſſage to <hi>David</hi> brings at once both pardon and puniſhment. The ſin is removed, but the ſword muſt ſtill ſtick in the bowels of his family, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin, thou ſhalt not dye. Howbeit becauſe by this deed, thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to Blaſpheme, the child alſo that is born unto thee ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> God may afflict temporally when he reſolves not to puniſh eternally. What! becauſe he will not condemn thee as a Judg, will he not chaſtize thee as a Father? We may well bear a ſcourge in one hand when we have a pardon ſealed in the other. God pardons thy ſin, but there is need of affliction to ſubdue that ſtout ſtubborn heart of thine. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32, 33. God doth viſit with rods, when he is reſolved not utterly to take away his loving kindneſs from a people.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Terrors of Conſcience are no ſign of an unpardoned ſtate.</hi> We find a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>David</hi> having broken bones and a rackt Conſcience after <hi>Nathan</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his pardon, when there was no remorſe before, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. He had the grant of a pardon, but the comfort of a pardon was wanting. God may ſcorch thy Soul, when he gives a pardon; not that juſtice is thereby Satisfied, but ſin more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered to thee. By a pardon thou doſt relliſh his mercy, and by the torments thou mayeſt have in thy Soul, thou wilt underſtand his Juſtice. He ſhews thee what he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives, but he would have thee know what thou haſt fully deſerved; he gives thee pardon, but Gall and Wormwood with it, that thou mayeſt know what the purchaſe of it did coſt thy Saviour. The Phyſick which heals, cauſeth pain. That Phyſick which doth not make thee ſick, is not like to bring thee health. God pardons thee, that thou mayeſt be ſaved; he terrifies thee withal, that thou mayeſt not be induced by temptations to ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Senſe of ſin is no argument of an unpardoned ſtate.</hi> A pardon may be granted, when the poor condemned man expects to be haled out to Execution. <hi>Mary</hi> ſtands weeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her Saviour, when Chriſt was declaring her pardon to <hi>Simon,</hi> That much was forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, and afterwards Chriſt turns to her, and cheers her with the news of it. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.44, 45, 46, 47. He pronounceth her pardon, v. 48. and the comfort of it, v. 50. <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace.</hi> The Heavens may drop, when now and then the Sun may ſteal a Beam thorow the Clouds. There may be a pardon, where there are not always the ſenſible effects of a pardon. We find, after the ſtilling of a Storm, the ragings and roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sea. A penitents wound may ake afreſh, when a Saviours blood drops in mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>The Remainders of ſin are not a ſign of an unpardoned ſtate.</hi> Though a Diſeaſe be maſtered by Phyſick, there may be ſome grudgings of it in a perſon. Though ſin be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the dregs of ſin will be remaining, and ſometimes ſtirring. Chriſt hath enliven'd us, not by wholly deſtroying, but pardoning ſin. Pardon takes away the guilt of ſin; grace takes away the power of ſin; but neither pardon, nor infuſion of grace, takes away the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all motions of ſin; for in purging out an humour, ſome dregs ſtill remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And you hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What are the true ſigns of a pardoned man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sincerity in our walk.</hi> A Spirit without guile, is made the Character of a pardoned man in the <hi>Text:</hi> There may be failings in the life, yet no guile in the heart; ſuch a man is a pardoned man: A heart that hath no mixtures, no pretences or excuſes for ſin, no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reſerves from God: A heart, that as the needle in a Compaſs, ſtands right for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt &amp; glory of God, &amp; anſwers to the profeſſion, as an <hi>Eccho</hi> to the voice: A heart that would thruſt out any ſin that harboured there, would not have an Atom of any filth odious to the Eye of God lurk there. Where this ſincerity is, a willingneſs and readineſs to obey God, (which is the condition of the Covenant) the ſubſtance of the Covenant is kept, though ſome particular Articles of it may be broken. <hi>Grace,</hi> the pardoning grace of God, is with them that love Chriſt in ſincerity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. Grace be with all them that love Chriſt Jeſus in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</hi> Not a man excluded that is ſincere; though he hath not ſo ſparkling a flame as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet if he be ſincere, the Crown of pardoning grace, and that of conſummating grace ſhall be ſet upon his head.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41445:60"/>(2.) <hi>Mourning for ſin.</hi> A tender heart is a ſign of a pardoned ſtate, when ſin diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thee becauſe it diſpleaſeth God. What ſhowers of tears did <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> weep after a pardon? Love to God, like a gentle fire, ſets the Soul a melting. Tears that come from love are never without pardoning mercy. God's bowels do firſt ſtir our mournings. 'Tis impoſſible a gracious heart can read a pardon with dry Eyes; 'tis the leaſt it thinks it can do, as it were, like <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to waſh Chriſt's feet with its tears, when it hath been waſhed its ſelf with Chriſt's blood. The Soul cannot enough hate that, which God hath been merciful in the pardon of. Forgiveneſs is like the warmth of the Spring, it draws out the Sap of the Tree, the tears of the Soul, which elſe would ſcarcely ſtir. If God hath given thee Repentance, it is ſure enough that he hath given thee a pardon, for if he did not mean to give thee that, he would never have given thee the other.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Fearfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Whoſoever knows the bitterneſs of ſin and the benefit of a pardon, can never confidently ruſh into it. A pardoned man will never go about to forfeit that which he hath newly received. Forgiveneſs from God doth produce fear in the creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> 'Tis a ſign we have repented and got pardon, if we find after that exerciſe of repentance and prayer, our hatred of ſin encreaſeth, eſpecially of that ſin we were guilty of before.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Sanctification.</hi> God never pardons but he ſubdues ſin, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our iniquity and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Both are put together. In the Lords prayer, deſires to be rid of all evil, and not to be led into any temptation follow immediately upon the deſire of pardon. A juſtified Perſon and a Sanctified nature are inſeparable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt</hi> [there is pardon;] but how ſhall I know that I am pardoned? If you <hi>walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> We never ſincerely deſire pardon, but we deſire purging, and God never gives the one, but he beſtows the other. If thou haſt an intereſt in a pardoning Chriſt, thou wilt have the effects of a Sanctifying Spirit. Where Gods grace forgives all ſin, he will give us grace to forſake all ſin. 'Tis his covenant to turn away ungodlineſs, when he takes away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. the <hi>deliverer ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods grace to us are attended with the infuſions of Gods grace into us. When <hi>he puts his law into the heart, he remembers ſin no more,</hi> Jer. 31.33, 34.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Forgiving others.</hi> In the Lords prayer we pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> Our Saviour comments upon this petition, to ſhew that pardon cannot be without this condition, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to the 35. Chriſt makes it at leaſt <hi>a cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> of pardon, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.4. <hi>and forgive us our ſins, for we alſo forgive every one that is indebted to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>Affectionate Love to God and Chriſt.</hi> When we deſire to glorify him by his grace, as well as be glorified by it. 'Tis the injury done to God by our ſins which doth moſt affect that heart upon which the Spirit of God is <hi>poured, Zac.</hi> 12.10. <hi>they ſhall mourn over him, or</hi> be in bitterneſs for him. The Soul is more concerned for Chriſt than for it ſelf. When there is too much of ſelf in our deſires for it, God delays the manifeſtation of it to the heart, that we may come up to purer ſtrains. Chriſt, certainly ſhed his blood for their remiſſion who are willing to ſhed theirs for his glory. Elſe Chriſt, whoſe glory it is to outſtrip the hotteſt affection of his creature, would be behind hand with him in love. That Soul that would ſpend its all upon Chriſt, he will not ſuffer to ſtand long ſobbing before him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47.</p>

               <p n="1">[1.] <hi>God is willing to pardon. Ephraim</hi> doth but deſire that God would turn him, and God preſently cries out, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child?</hi> Jer. 31.18, 20. <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf thus.</hi> A penitent <hi>Ephraim</hi> is inſtantly a pleaſant Child. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſtrikes upon his thigh with confeſſion, and God ſpeaks to his heart with affection. God doth as it were take the words out of <hi>Ephraims</hi> mouth, as though he watched for the firſt look of <hi>Ephraim</hi> towards him, or the firſt breath of a Supplication. God is more willing to pardon ſin than we are to ſin; Becauſe we ſin with reluctancy, natural conſcience checking us, but God hath no check when he goes to pardon. He <hi>waits to be gracious,</hi> Iſa. 30.18. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you.</hi> He hath waited all the time of your ſinning, to have an opportunity to ſhew grace to you; and now you give it him by repenting, will he loſe the fruit of his waiting? 'Tis the end of Chriſts exaltation, whether it be meant of his being lifted up on the croſs, or his exaltation in Heaven; 'tis true of both, that his end is to have mercy upon you.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41445:61"/> himſelf to beſtow it. When thou beggeſt other things, thou mayeſt diſhonour God; but God cannot be a loſer of his glory in granting this. Lord if thou turneſt me into Hell, where is the glory of thy mercy upon thy creature? Nay, where is the glory of thy juſtice, my eternal torments not being able to compenſate the injury done to thee by ſin, ſo much as the ſuffering of thy only Son, whoſe death I deſire to ſhare in, and whoſe terms I am willing to ſubmit to?</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Admire this grace of God.</hi> To pardon one ſin is a greater thing than to create a world, to pardon one ſin is greater than to damn a world. God can create a world without the death of a creature, he can damn a world without the death of the Creator, but in pardoning there muſt be the death of the Creator, the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Serve God much.</hi> Is the guilt of ſin, the cord that bound thee, taken off? It is fit that when thou art ſo unfettered, thou ſhould'ſt run the ways of Gods Commandments. A ſenſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin makes the Soul willing and ready to run upon Gods errands, and to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.8. <hi>I heard the voice of the Lord ſaying, Whom ſhall I ſend? Then ſaid I, Here am I: Then,</hi> when he had received aſſurance that his iniquity was taken away, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Gods pardon ſet thee upon a new ſtock, and therefore he expects thou ſhould'ſt be full of new cluſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Be more fearful of ſin.</hi> Diſpute with thy ſelf, Hath God pardoned the guilt of ſin that it ſhall not damn me? and ſhall I wallow in the mire of ſin to pollute my ſelf? Oh, thy ſins after pardon have a blacker circumſtance than the ſins of Devils, or the ſins of wicked men, for theirs are not againſt pardoning mercy, not againſt ſpecial Love. Oh, thaw thy heart every morning with a meditation on pardon, and ſin will not ſo eaſily freeze it in the day time. When thou art tempted to ſin, conſider what thoughts thou hadſt when thou wert ſuing for pardon, how earneſt thou wert for it, what promiſes and vows thou didſt make, and conſider the Love God ſhewed thee in pardoning. Do not blur thy pardon, ſo eaſily wound thy Conſcience, or weaken thy faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Be content with what God gives thee.</hi> If he gives thee Heaven, will he deny thee earth? He that beſtows upon thee the pardon of ſin, would ſurely pour into thy boſom the gold of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> were it neceſſary for thee. But thou haſt got a greater happineſs; for it is not ſaid, bleſſed is he that wallows in wealth, honour and a confluence of worldly proſperity, but <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe ſin is forgiven, and whoſe iniquity is covered.</hi>
